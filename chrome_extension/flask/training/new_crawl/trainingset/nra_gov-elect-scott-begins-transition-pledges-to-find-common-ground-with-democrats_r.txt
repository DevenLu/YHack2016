montpelier republican scott claimed a mandate wednesday for his incoming administration to focus on the economy while pledging to work with the legislature to improve the fiscal lives of vermonters scott defeated democratic gubernatorial nominee sue minter tuesday by a percent to percent margin in january he will be sworn in as the states governor but vermonters send mixed signals at the voting booth they opted for progress and democratic nominee david over republican randy brock for lieutenant governor and senate democrats expanded their dominance by two seats and now control of the total seats still scott in a state house news conference said wednesday he believes vermonters spoke clearly and definitely and support his economic agenda over that of democrats in the legislature think vermonters are putting them on notice think my election was a mandate in terms of this crisis of is real they want some action on the economy they want to have to struggle they want to have to work two and three jobs to make ends meet they want a better vermont so my election believe is a mandate scott standing in front of a bust of abraham lincoln told reporters scott said vermonters looked at the differing views he and hold and chose him to be the states chief executive think very independent as we know throughout vermont was elected this is my ninth election and was elected and served in the minority my entire time so think vermonters just look for having trust and faith in their leadership and are independently minded he said describing himself as a moderate centrist republican scott will take office in january with plenty of uncertainty because republican donald trumps victory trump has advocated for repealing the federal affordable care act or if he does its unclear where health care reform in vermont and around the country will stand scott has said he wants to transition the states health insurance marketplace created under to the federal exchange but it may not exist in trumps administration well see know theres a lot of campaign promises made on the national level but well wait and see sure well have something in place and well act accordingly scott said he acknowledged the unease that many vermonters and americans felt wednesday as they processed trumps victory over democrat an outcome that seemed unfathomable just a day before whether it was a administration or a trump administration have a deep amount of respect for the office and will do whatever can to support vermont in any way can scott said of course we know whats going to happen in the future but look forward to working with the administration in any way we can to make sure vermont is put up in the front scott who said he cast a vote for ohio gov john said he has faith in americas constitutional democracy in the years months and years ahead scott was less than reassuring however saying vermont and the country would survive this there is a deep amount of trepidation think for the future but at the same time think we all need to pull together and realize that we have a democracy in place we have a senate and house on the federal level and we will come together as one and work through this have a deep amount of faith and trust in the process and believe it will be ok he said scott was already working on the transition from the administration of outgoing democratic gov peter on wednesday he announced that tim hayward who served as chief of staff to former republican gov jim douglas will lead his transition team another former douglas official who served as secretary of administration will head the budget committee that will help craft first state budget despite tapping the former douglas staffers to aid the transition scott said he will be staking out his own agenda rather than rehashing what douglas sought to do between and very fortunate to have some people that were very capable during that time that have stopped forward and will help us through the transition but thats as far as it goes at this point he said think they have a level of expertise certainly my thoughts matter the and take their lead from me meanwhile debbie winters owner of sprinklers and independent state rep laura will lead leadership advisory committee that will help find appointees in administration so we can find the best and brightest minds he said putting together a very capable team to make sure we have a strong budget in place that the transition is smooth for vermonters as we accomplish the goals we set during the election and will keep everyone updated as that process continues scott said this is an important time for our state theres no doubt the challenges we face are real but the opportunities are also real and together were going to move our state forward for all vermonters told the vermont press bureau wednesday that he and his team will assist scott in any way they can ran a good campaign a friend of mine worked together for years both in the senate and he was on my cabinet throughout my governorship so my job now is to ensure that we do everything we can this is a very tough job being governor and its the most important job in vermont said it helps that we have a friendship we know each other well were just going to be available to them in any way that they wish scott promised to consider all qualified people for appointments in his administration being a republican a litmus test for our administration what looking for is talent people that understand that the economy is important that the crisis is real and share my vision for a much better vermont so will look forward to anyone who wants to apply and submit their resume he said scott also signaled that he is prepared to hold his ground against some of the initiatives that may come his way during the upcoming legislative session he will not support any new restrictions on guns including universal background checks he said but stopped short of issuing a veto threat think was pretty clear in the campaign that believe that we need to take this subject up at this time well wait and see if this comes to my desk he also remains opposed to legalizing marijuana any time soon even as massachusetts voters to the immediate south of vermont passed a referendum for recreational cannabis as said during the campaign was never one to say never in terms of legalization just said that it time at this point look forward to learning from the other states who have legalized and maybe massachusetts as well learning from them he said well keep in mind that we have to deal with the edibles we have to deal with impairment on our highways as well as the tax structure if thats the way they move forward and scott said he will continue to follow the rate of economic growth and wages in vermont to determine how much the state budget will grow under his administration he promised during the campaign that he would not sign a budget that grows faster than economic growth it will be a combination of the two scott said advocates hoping to usher in major changes in vermont like raising the minimum wage beyond where it is already set to rise and paid family leave will also find hurdles under scott he indicated he would look to raise incomes through an improved economy rather than by boosting the minimum wage even more we just did that and think putting the cart before the horse made that pretty clear during the campaign just think the struggling businesses on main street are just that right on the edge and not sure they can afford that increase at this point in time the said scott said he would look to work with advocates on some issues want everyone to make more money in vermont and think having a thriving prosperous economy is one way of getting there going to look for more with our higher so look forward to working with them on that he said think there are a number of ways we can work together early childhood development is something passionate about think its important and think we can find ways to work together there as well despite is comfortable margin of victory of minter scott told reporters that he was unsure how the race would end know what to expect yesterday morning when woke up was fully prepared to not be successful but was comfortable in the fact that ran the campaign that wanted to run and ran it in a positive way change a thing was comfortable win lose or draw he said with victory in hand scott must now look ahead to working with opposition democrats in the legislature and work on a budget and legislation that will work for both sides look forward to working with them well sit down well talk about the issues where we find common ground and well try and advocate for that believe having the economy grow and prosper is something that everyone should be interested in well look at the housing issue and find ways to work together in that regard and deal with this crisis he said look for common ground and working together been a consensus builder my entire political life always served in the minority so this is nothing new sure we can find common ground
