donald trumps legions of rabid supporters are in for an unpleasant shock once they figure out how many of his campaign promises going to on yesterday he announced he be repealing the entirety of the affordable care act which is all the has tried to do for the past eight years today he suddenly announced that he going to be ripping up president historic nuclear peace treaty with the islamic republic of iran speaking to the trump advisor and former lebanese christian terrorist detailed trumps backtrack ripping up is maybe a too strong of word take that agreement its been done before in international context and then review it he will take the agreement review it send it to congress demand from the iranians to restore a few issues or change a few issues and there will be a discussion a few issues is quite a retreat from the worst deal ever negotiated and a disaster and that tearing it up would be his number one priority but to be fair trump may have just been informed that in fact you cannot simply just tear up international agreements that involve multiple major powers on a whim he has also gone to great lengths to tarnish the image of the deal in the eyes of the american people turning the return of million in undelivered fighter jet money to iran from a deal that was never fulfilled into an outrageous and entirely false allegation of a billion ransom but then again trump who have the decency to pay american workers who provide goods and services for him seem to understand how the basic concepts of how deals work at all president nuclear treaty has kept the united states safe from the threat of a potential iranian nuclear weapon for years and opened up an important avenue of dialog with which was closed before its looking like the trump presidency that was promised to the republican party is shaping up very differently indeed and its only been four days
