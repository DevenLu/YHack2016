republican nominee donald trump and his campaign are having a very difficult time in their efforts to convince themselves and the nation that they still have a viable shot at the presidency contrary to the mountain of polling data that shows otherwise the implosion continued this evening when trump surrogate newt blew his top at fox news anchor during tonights episode of the file when she challenged him on the polling numbers which show trump far behind numbers so poor that even former stalwart republican strongholds like texas and arizona are now in play for the democratic nominee quite reasonably pointed to the national backlash that trump is facing from the leaked tapes which show him casually boasting of sexually assaulting women the testimony of a dozen or so women who have accused him of sexually assaulting him and his attempts to gaslight the nation into somehow dismissing them all as opportunist provocateurs orchestrated by the campaign like that and proceeded to go full trump on the stunned news anchor sick and tired of people like you using language thats inflammatory thats not when you use the words you took a position and think its very unfair of you to do that you go back through the tapes of your show recently you are fascinated with sex and you care about public policy thats what get out of watching you tonight people like you he says by that he means the media or anybody who dares to poke holes into the fanciful delusions that the trump campaign has constructed for itself this kind of chauvinistic rebuke laced with the misogyny that old white men tend to show when challenged by a woman shows just how unrepentant the trump campaign truly is and how unwilling they are to face the music against overwhelming evidence they will shout until they are blue in the face like spoilt toddlers which accurately describes both the candidate and many of his surrogates but america knows the truth and they will pay for it on november watch it here
