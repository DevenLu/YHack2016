first of all id like to say something about my cousin billy bush been in the news a lot lately him and that disgraced pumpkin donald trump talking on the bus just want to say one thing we bushes act like that okay we have standards and were raised certain way we would never under any circumstances ride a bus when a bush you ride in a limousine or a jump jet or maybe a monster truck called express never a bus then goes on point out that somehow the utterly abhorrent character of republican nominee donald trump has whitewashed less viscerally appalling but equally reprehensible legacy nobody should forget how the great recession was engineered and executed under the watch of george bush or how the wars he began mortgaged our nations future and led to the deaths of millions around the world one shudders to think of what a president trump would do to this country and the safety of the free world watch it here
