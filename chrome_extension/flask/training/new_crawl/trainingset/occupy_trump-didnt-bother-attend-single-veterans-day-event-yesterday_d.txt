veterans day came and went with millions of americans around the nation coming together to share a somber embrace of dignity honor and respect for those who have served or are actively serving in the united states military one face was notably absent from the thousands of celebrations dotted across america donald trump who apparently did not attend a single veterans day celebration despite his impending rise to commander in chief of the entire united states military in just a few short weeks if trump were looking for a way in which to endear himself to the troops of which trump is solely responsible for issuing orders for them to risk their lives this was likely not the best route after spending months describing how much respect he has for the military while simultaneously attacking veterans like john for being captured during vietnam and the family of fallen service members like khan for the calamitous offense of being a muslim trump was nowhere to be found there is not a single note record or press release of trump making any public appearances on veterans day in fact unless one follows trumps twitter feed one might believe he was completely unaware the national holiday was even happening trump wrote on twitter that was it nothing else he visit a graveyard he make any telephone calls to military families he visit the thousands of americans recovering from various wounds and afflictions in our nations veterans hospitals he even bring a dish to pass at a local community center potluck for veterans when a minor gesture can make the difference to so many who have put their lives on the line to defend america trump decided that no gestures were required one can imagine the outrage of conservatives if the roles were reversed and president failed to make an appearance at a public event honoring veterans there would be calls for lack of patriotism and that he was a traitor to those who serve under him they would say that is a weak leader and does not inspire the troops the babble would be endless and full of empty righteous indignation those scenarios happen however because president was at arlington national cemetery on veterans day where he gave a humble speech about the thousands who are laid to rest and to offer his sincere gratitude for the bravery of the fallen thats what a president should do that is the duty of a president which is something donald trump clearly does not understand watch full veterans day remarks below
