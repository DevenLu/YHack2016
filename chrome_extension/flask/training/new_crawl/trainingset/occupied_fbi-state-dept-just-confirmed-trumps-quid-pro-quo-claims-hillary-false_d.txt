a minor political scandal has arisen for democratic nominee after the fbi revealed meeting notes yesterday with a discussion between bureaucrats from the two agencies about classifying records in case this clear work for the state department now and had not at the time for three years president said that run the most transparent administration in american history and now that very openness has caused legitimate if highly unusual as the fbi traditionally release investigatory files amount of discussion because the american public knows the whole truth which includes the messy interpersonal communications down to the letter the current misunderstanding between agencies arose when the fbi official contacted undersecretary of state for management patrick kennedy about an unrelated matter of overseas staffing level months later when kennedy called back he had questions about and a discussion ensued on both topics between the unnamed fbi official and the state department official as the washington post reported originally no tangible swap ever came to pass the was classified in accordance with the original wishes and the bureau was not given any additional personnel in iraq both the fbi and the state department denied that a quid pro quo ever existed the documents released monday include summaries of more than three dozen interviews with technology company employees fbi agents and diplomatic security officers who worked with according to a summary of his interview the international operations division had been trying to reach kennedy on an unrelated matter for some months and kennedy called back wanting to talk about kennedy the international operations official told investigators said he wanted to change the classification of a that was causing problems the state department was reviewing the for release under the freedom of information act it had submitted some all of which were marked unclassified for the fbi to review and the fbi determined that at least one appeared to contain classified information the federal classification system in play here allows the originating agency to determine the classification level of any particular document that is how the system is designed but somehow the investigation devolved in classic dc paperwork then government agencies competed to label documents for a whole year so when the fbi run by republican jim who was acting us attorney general during the last bush administration released a batch of documents this week which included the confusing notes a state department official went on to to give further evidence of the these notes contain not only is there no proof its absolutely not true a completely false allegation it just happen that way john state department spokesman told on new day tuesday there was no bargain sought by the fbi there was no bargain rendered this was simply an inner agency conversation about the classification over one particular so there was no wrongdoing here the fbi is denying that any quid pro quo was offered in the fight between the bureau and state department over the classification level of the though one interview described it as such at issue are somewhat contradictory interview notes contained in the crop of newly released fbi documents its important to note that these are the messy disclosures of normal human behavior theres no evidence of anything but one conversation with a misunderstanding memorialized for the record to make sure that there was no impropriety transparency is good for america which is so obvious that even congressional republicans decided to pass a law and president signed the new improvement bill without fanfare this pas to ensure more transparency by whomever the american people choose to carry on his legacy of steady governance the republican nominee is sure to make up a fantastic story about this disclosure in tomorrow nights third and final presidential debate but already debunked trumps top lies about the thefts which struck democratic nominee campaign manager the parallels between the trump campaign and watergate are unmistakable if not blatantly obvious and even with extreme transparency there has been nothing about the democratic nominee exposed other than her more human side prone to making insightful remarks that fit for the scripted and cautious world of political public speaking at its highest level democratic nominee can easily claim to be the most investigated person in modern american history yet some members of the media will scream scandal at every turn even if theres no there there here they go again
