republican nominee donald trump is very fond of pretending he has more support than he does pandering to new england patriots fans today in manchester new hampshire trump today announced that legendary quarterback tom voted for him and that received a letter from coach bill has already revealed in a radio interview that he has not voted yet a fan asked his wife on social media whether or not they were supporting trump heard you and tom were backing trump is that was quick to deflate trumps false assertion with an unequivocal no but it does appear that the letter from was in fact from him as confirmed by he did not intend for it to be read aloud however but thats what you get for sending evidence of your support to a volatile maniac like trump this is not likely to improve the popularity of the patriots who are almost universally reviled outside of new england for their tendencies to bend the rules and for their frustratingly consistent dominance but at least ms has her priorities straight and as slates jordan remarked imagine that in the household what says goes letter to trump or at least the version trump read at the rally is as follows congratulations on a tremendous campaign you have dealt with an unbelievable slanted and negative media and have come out beautifully beautifully proved to be the ultimate competitor and fighter your leadership is amazing have always had tremendous respect for you but the toughness and perseverance you have displayed over the past year is remarkable hopefully tomorrows election results will give the opportunity to make america great again best wishes for great results tomorrow
