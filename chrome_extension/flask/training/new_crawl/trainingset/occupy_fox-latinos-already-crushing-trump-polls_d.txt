republicans are fond of blaming the media for their troubles but never blaming voters for utterly rejecting their platform of racism hatred and economic inequality to some republican voters it will even come as a surprise that donald trump loses next weeks election but the signs were all there and heres an excerpt from just one of the rare fox news stories that admits it sleeping giant awake and roaring early voting shows high latino turnout the tens of millions of early votes cast point to strength from latino voters potentially giving a significant advantage in nevada and colorado with more than half the votes already cast in those states democrats are matching if not exceeding their successful pace according to data compiled by the associated press latinos another group that democrats have been banking on are turning out in larger numbers than anticipated and they very well may be the ones who give the presidential nominee the margin of victory we are seeing the trajectory of the election change in some states but democrats are also making up ground said michael mcdonald a university of florida professor and expert in voter turnout they let or on to fox news latino which is probably why it actually publishes some factual stories unlike fox news or fox business who just today had to retract an entirely false story about democratic nominee meanwhile exit polling is showing that latinos have the same high level of regard for in florida that they have for president this level of support is considered key to the democratic nominees strategy to win the sunshine state which would act as a closing almost all of the republican nominees paths to the presidency the miami herald reports has hit a key marker among florida hispanics according to a new poll shes reached the level of popularity that helped president win the nations largest battleground state in the polls further indicate that will probably get at least of the latino vote in florida but theres of the sample that is still not decided so it could be much higher by the time election day finishes politico is reporting that the democratic nominees lead amongst latino voters in florida just a problem for trump but that for the entire its a terrifying prospect for the wing of the republican party that likes to win elections this poll is probably invoking the moment where they see their entire electoral history as the party of lincoln flash before its eyes which can only mean that the end of the decadently twisted grand old party is near republicans wrote an autopsy of their party after their politics of division hatred and the blew the election which declared the dead in the water particularly the report cited the tea radical policies racist dog whistles and the war on women luckily that spurred the rank and file voters in to pick an orange zombie presidential candidate a man who has turned off women and latinos like a switch and added muslims finished off black people and finally convinced college educated voters to trust that the democratic party is the only rational political actor that can be trusted donald trumps safe zone the fox news network is reporting a massive turnout in the latino communities the republican candidate so despises now there is absolutely no way he can claim that the election is rigged next tuesday night when all of the major news networks pronounce his campaign dead and the republican party along with it
