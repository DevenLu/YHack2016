washington the fewest americans in years favor making it illegal to manufacture sell or possess guns known as assault rifles percent now want an assault weapons ban down from in and when gallup first asked the question in assault rifles have been a contentious issue in american life for decades two years after president bill signed a federal assault weapons ban in gallup found that a solid majority of americans favored such a ban by the time the ban expired in americans were evenly divided and by public opinion had tilted against the assault weapons ban with opposed and in favor in crime poll conducted opposition now exceeds support by percentage points to perhaps paradoxically opposition toward a ban has increased against a backdrop of multiple mass shootings and terrorist attacks in which the perpetrators used assault rifles these guns were used in incidents including the terrorist attacks in san california and and the mass shootings in aurora colorado and connecticut support for ban wanes among democrats republicans in the past years support for an assault weapons ban has fallen among all partisan groups but more so among republicans than democrats currently of democrats and of republicans favor a ban in of democrats and of republicans did so the partisan gap in support has doubled from points in to points today independents also have grown less inclined to back an assault weapons ban dropping from a peak of in favor of a ban in to in the latest poll from to support among independents plunged from to echoing the drop among republicans during that period both gun and households retreat in ban support support for a ban has declined among both those with and those without a gun in the home in of those in households supported a ban this year do likewise while those with a gun in the home have never favored a ban on assault weapons support is now at an low of americans living in households with guns have consistently been less likely than those in households to favor a ban the percentage of those with a gun in the home who favor an assault weapons ban has declined steadily since americans less likely to favor tougher gun laws in general the decline in support for an assault weapons ban mirrors the trend for those saying there should be a law banning the possession of handguns except by the police or other authorized people currently of americans favor such a ban down from in and in at the same time of americans say laws covering the sale of firearms should be made more strict with saying the laws should be less strict and saying they should be kept as they are now the percentage favoring stricter gun laws has fluctuated between and since with no clear increase or decrease in support but it is down from levels consistently at or above in the including a high of in bottom line in an era of ongoing terrorist attacks and mass shootings in the americans are now more likely to oppose an assault weapons ban than they have been in two decades one reason may be the large increase in opposition to such a ban among republicans whereas years ago half of republicans were open to such legislation now only one in four are but politics alone do not explain the declining support since it has dropped among independents and democrats as well although on a smaller scale it is possible this represents a backlash against calls by some in the national media and the federal government to ban certain weapons after mass shootings occur this backlash may reflect growing apprehension that the government may infringe upon particular civil and personal liberties gallup finds even lower levels of support for other potential bans such as those on handguns and cigarettes it is striking and unusual that fewer democrats than ever support an assault weapons ban since the democratic party has been instrumental in pushing for stricter gun laws however it is worth noting that a majority of americans still believe there should be stricter laws governing the sale of firearms even as they are reluctant to endorse a ban on handguns and assault weapons in general a majority of americans say they are dissatisfied with the gun laws furthering the complexity of this issue historical data are available in gallup results for this gallup poll are based on telephone interviews conducted with a random sample of adults aged and older living in all states and the district of columbia for results based on the total sample of national adults the margin of sampling error is percentage points at the confidence level all reported margins of sampling error include computed design effects for weighting each sample of national adults includes a minimum quota of respondents and respondents with additional minimum quotas by time zone within region and cellular telephone numbers are selected using methods view complete question responses and trends learn more about how the gallup poll social series works copyright gallup inc all rights reserved
