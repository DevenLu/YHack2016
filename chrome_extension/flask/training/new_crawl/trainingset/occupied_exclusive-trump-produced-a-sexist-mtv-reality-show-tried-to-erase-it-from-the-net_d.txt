in this elections first presidential debate democratic nominee baited her republican opponent into a misogynist rampage just by mentioning the degrading things said to women in public over the years how might this weeks enraged donald trump react trying to explain the brutal descriptions of the women who starred in his sexist reality television show about a finishing school named the girls of all that remains today is a short videos of trumps tv company exploiting aged women video of the launch press conference which you can see below read trump productions description of the reality tv participants below once and instantly know why took the shows and the republican nominees wont even refer to it by name on his web page has yanked all of the episodes from their and streaming service luckily someone saved many pages of the shows original web site on or we would know nothing at all about it it seems pretty obvious why trump and the network have kept their mouths shut during this election about the sexist shows existence which is little more than a page with broken links today he told the new york post that he would troll the clubs to find women for his show at one point he wanted to call it lady or tramp and air the disastrous program on the fox network republican nominee donald trump has struggled throughout the campaign to explain his inexcusably degrading treatment of women his campaign imploded entirely is weekend after a newly revealed access hollywood audio recording caught him reveling in adultery and sexual assault leading trump to issue the worst apology ever three years after that bombshell audio recording and producer donald trump ran trump productions where he produced an embarrassingly sexist reality tv show named the girls of hall with in about an extreme girls finishing school since the reality tv show originally aired most of the girls of halls has been erased from the by both the network and trumps production company trumps embarrassing program seems to have revolved around trumps hyped up extreme measures to demean his shows bad girls as a method of changing them for the better apparently extreme is one of trumps buzzwords just like his extreme vetting idea to discriminate against in this instance the republican recycled his failed reality tv idea to finish girls right into his failed reality tv political campaign and with similarly disastrous results as television programming goes it was little more than a television program about featuring the frequent degradation of the unlucky contestants on camera one of whom gave an exclusive interview about her harrowing experience on the set the republican nominees television production staff hesitate to openly degrade participating women on their or on camera either because the lengthy contractual agreement to participate required those women to legally waive their rights to sue for libel slander or their portrayal in fact trumps show promoted its stinging instructors as a special feature of the reality show in each episode the girls of hall will be taught an important lesson from how to make a good first impression and always look their best to how to maintain a positive attitude and maintain composure in the face of conflict these humbling exercises will come with harsh critiques from their mentors as well as the possibility of elimination based on their performance think about the real meaning of this bit of for a moment humbling exercises will come with harsh critiques the republican nominees brilliant television production revolved around judging women and humbling them with harsh words presumably to produce a handsome profit for the donald the republican nominee licensed his shows concept and working title from the program to lady which is how its referred to on trumps today and curiously not by its name on or its title he only took credit for executive producing two episodes on and one can imagine how bad the show had to be for the donald trump to pass up credit for anything the program was hosted by controversial former miss usa conner whose public treatment in trumps pageant business gave birth to the republican nominees feud with starting back in trump is incapable of letting any insult go and spontaneously destructed in the first debate by renewing his war of words with the former daytime tv star speaking of trumps horrid stewardship of the once proud miss usa contest just this weekend a new audio recording emerged with trump bragging on the stern show about peeping on his pageant contestants naked backstage emerged his reality show featured a schoolmarm scolding the women on camera in a house named outside london england thats also also featured in abbey cast members said it was a hostile production environment from the moment participants landed where producers confiscated their passports and used coercive tactics to set the women on edge theres still press conference photos on images of donald trump and the host conner trump press releases with have since vanished from their starting points on the net already but can still be still found on a few remote entertainment and say that nobody knew how extreme the measures trump productions would use and according to former cast member the tactics were similar to that described in the trump models lawsuit it was really trump produced the show it was filmed in london in our contract it said any participant can leave whenever they want so when got assaulted asked to leave the show the producers told me leaving will be hard considering we have your legally speaking pretty sure you take passport unless you are law enforcement not sure if the term is entrapment or and that was just the beginning mercifully trumps crazy cross between jersey drama and an english finishing school came to an end after only eight episodes when it got cancelled ironically the republican nominee was kicking the trump university scam into high gear at the same time that this fake school was bombing on television republicans just accepted trumps business prowess based on little more than his public relations claims alone digging even slightly deeper reveals that the boorish candidates sexism was apparent this whole time even if trump did do a fine job of hiding it in plain sight with a lot of help from the network even though it appears that the republicans campaign for president has crossed the threshold from awful to nearly lost theres still an election coming and it behooves all voters to learn exactly what kind of sexist reality tv show donald trump produced donald trump should release the tapes of the girls at hall immediately then release his missing tax returns because as showed there are still undecided voters out there learning about the republican worst candidate in american history and the only qualified candidate democratic nominee research for this story came from the archives machine which is a neutral third party source that saves web pages and is admissible as evidence even in a federal court
