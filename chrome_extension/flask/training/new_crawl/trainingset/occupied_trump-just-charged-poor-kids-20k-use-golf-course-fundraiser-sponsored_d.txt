its an understatement to say that republican nominee donald trump does not have a good record when it comes to charity and donating to good causes but as the death knell sounds for his campaign he still changing his miserly ways new reports indicate that trump graciously allowed the palm beach boys girls club to hold a at the trump international golf course in florida and then charged them for the favor this free event is costing us between golf and catering fees what we had hoped for as far as a net income for this event has been cut in half we are lucky complained mark vice president of philanthropy for the boys and girls clubs the course usually charges around and leaves the county off the hook for the rest but not this time the annual charitable tournament goes to a different organization every year it just so happens that this years choice was made by district commissioner who is a democrat none of this was disclosed to me when given the choice to select a charity was under the impression the charity was able to host the event without any charges explain to me how this is supposed to be a benefit to the county demanded in an if were the boys girls club would pull out how are smaller charities supposed to be able to afford this this has placed me and the charity in a very bad position and am quite upset by it neither the trump international golf course nor the trump campaign have responded to requests for comment washington post reporter david has undertaken a minutely detailed investigation into donald trumps charitable past and found that he has donated far less than he claims to have given most of the money trump has donated was donated to the trump foundation by other donors many charities including those belonging to veterans organizations were promised donations that were never paid out its been discovered that the trump foundation was never properly certified to solicit donations in the first place and research shows that trump has been using his charitable foundation to launder money through to evade millions in taxes trump would charge a starving person for the scraps from his table he has not a charitable bone in his body his selfishness is legendary and we cannot elect such a morally deficient man to the presidency
