the editorial board at the yale review gave the most curious of democratic nominee this election season has yet seen and with a lesson that most of the republican political complex and especially nominee donald trump should learn quickly if he wants to keep himself out of even more legal trouble in its history the yale record has never endorsed a democratic candidate for president in fact we have never endorsed any candidate for president this is in part due to our strong commitment to being a organization which mandates that we are absolutely prohibited from directly or indirectly participating in or intervening in any political campaign on behalf of in opposition to any candidate for elective public office this years presidential election is highly unusual but ultimately no different the yale record believes both candidates to be equally due to our faithful compliance with the tax code in particular we do not endorse exemplary leadership during her years in the public eye we do not support her impressive commitment to serving and improving this commitment to which she has dedicated her entire professional career because of unambiguous tax law we do not encourage you to support the most qualified presidential candidate in modern american history nor do we encourage all citizens to shatter the glass ceiling once and for all by electing secretary on november organizations like the yale record and the donald trump foundation must obey certain rules to keep their status rules that the trump foundation has been flouting for its entire existence trumps been using his private foundation which is funded almost entirely by the donations of other people to purchase the political support of different groups throughout his campaign among other more personal purchases like a painting of himself in clear violation of the rules trumps foundation has already been suspended from operating in new york for not having the right certification to solicit donors such a flagrant disrespect for the laws of the land and of the spirit of charity reveal just what kind of man donald trump is a greedy narcissist with no regard for the of others so take this to heart and applaud their respect for the rules governing organizations however is under no such restrictions and we heartily encourage you to help shatter the glass ceiling and make former secretary of state our next president
