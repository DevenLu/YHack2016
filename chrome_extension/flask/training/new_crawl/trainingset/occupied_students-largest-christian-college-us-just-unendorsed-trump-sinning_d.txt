the students at liberty want the world to know that in spite of school president jerry unyielding support of donald trump this is not how they will be voting on election day a statement from liberty united against trump was released denigrating trumps affiliation with the evangelical school calling the candidate unchristian and setting the record straight that they want nothing to do with him the students felt it was imperative that they spoke up following the leak of trumps now infamous recording to access hollywood in which he brags about sexually assaulting women over students alumni and faculty have signed the statement authored by a junior at the school meanwhile president continues to callously defend trump saying that it is irrelevant whether the allegations against him are true responding donald trump of five ten years ago even two or three years ago may have been a different person the bigger point is he is going to appoint the right justices to the supreme court going to control immigration going to bring our country back to a position of strength again and that is why supporting donald trump he has also denied that he is advocating on behalf of trump and linking liberty university into the mess though this is obviously what he has been doing adding insult to injury claims that his students are ignoring the teachings of jesus and that the statement is incoherent and false like donald trump is going to have to recognize reality the evangelical university president has yet to acknowledge that he is alone in his support of a sexual predator his students are with being associated with trumps sinister values as the statement reads not only is donald trump a bad candidate for president he is actively promoting the very things that we as christians ought to oppose the statement goes on astutely pointing out any faculty or staff member at liberty would be terminated for such comments and yet when donald trump makes them president rushes eagerly to his defense taking the name liberty university with him the students continue it is not enough to criticize these kinds of comments we must make clear to the world that while everyone is a sinner and everyone can be forgiven a man who constantly and proudly speaks evil does not deserve our support for the nations highest office and finally as clear as day they conclude because our president has led the world to believe that liberty university supports donald trump we students must take it upon ourselves to make clear that donald trump is absolutely opposed to what we believe and does not have our support as the petition against trump continues to grow at liberty university other schools have withdrawn their support of trump including university of virginia college republicans as well as the college republicans at college who note that electing trump could cause a potentially permanent stain on our brand and our country students at liberty virginia college and we stand with you in your opposition of what might be americas worst presidential candidate ever related items jerry style trump
