the next person to be shot in an ohio school could be at the hands of a teacher allowed to carry a gun in a trend that has grown rapidly since the late school shooting at sandy hook elementary school an increasing number of school districts around ohio have authorized teachers and school staff members to carry concealed firearms in classrooms but which schools allow armed teachers or which teachers volunteer to be armed across ohio is not known details of the policies are legally allowed to be secret and some districts do little to let the public know such a policy has even been enacted but expert estimates put the number of districts arming staff members at more than or more than one in four districts in the state the surge in such policies is significant for ohio students parents and for those who work in schools some view allowing the concealed carry of firearms at schools as a major boost to staff and student safety if a child or other perpetrator goes on a shooting spree an armed teacher can kill the shooter before more lives are lost others flatly oppose the measures citing a raft of concerns including the potential for accidents potential confusion over distinguishing a shooter from a staff member and worries that armed staff members are to manage the authority to take a life during a crisis five years ago we probably have considered it and even three or two years ago would still have been saying this is not the direction we want to go said david hire superintendent of city schools who hopes to have armed staff members in his schools by year end but were living in a society where this is becoming almost weekly or every other week where there is some event somewhere around the country school policies in ohio on guns vary districts have long been allowed by state law to authorize specific staff members such as teachers custodians or administrators to carry concealed weapons few if any districts were known to have done so until the dec sandy hook shooting when children and six adults were fatally shot by a gunman in connecticut following that incident the buckeye firearms association which advocates for gun ownership and fewer gun control laws began more actively promoting the arming of school staff along with spearheading a training program for school employees who want to carry concealed firearms in schools the west tactical defense institute funded by the buckeye firearms foundation said that it has trained staff members from districts around the state to carry concealed firearms as more schools have adopted such measures district administrators have begun to get more comfortable with the notion of arming school staff said hire who estimates as many as districts in the state have adopted the firearms measures hire said he expects that number to continue to grow it has always been the thinking that we need to go in this direction hire said but said so impressed with the quality of the training and what they are learning that think this is something we need to talk about there is no official list of which ohio schools allow school staff to carry concealed weapons and it always easy to find out if such policies are in place school districts are required to adopt policies in public school board meetings but ohio law gives districts the ability to keep much about arming staff members secret because school security plans public that can lead to some schools disclosing their approach and others staying mum the city schools district for example adopted a concealed firearms policy in a public meeting in june but at east local schools the neighboring district to the east parents and students are kept in the dark on whether staff members are carrying guns or not as protected by the law school safety plans are not public record superintendent jill said in an inquiring as to whether the school district has adopted a policy to arm its staff many school superintendents however are quick to say they support arming school staff members city schools does not have a policy that allows staff to carry concealed firearms the district has no plans to develop such a said city schools superintendent as far as a lethal response with a gun were not comfortable with it here said colonel local schools superintendent martin whose schools are near he said he is an avid supporter of the right to bear arms holds a concealed carry permit and carries a gun when not at school plus he was stabbed during a hostage situation with a student in despite that incident and his experience with firearms martin said he still is against carrying guns in school and personally feel qualified to draw a firearm to diffuse a school shooting incident if going to have a gun on the premises id rather have a resource officer who has been trained martin said if going to defend myself in the community not firing around potentially kids in classrooms and hallways colonel does not employ a resource officer typically a sworn local police officer who acts as a security guard for schools but many schools do liberty local schools in county opted not to arm school staff members instead the district made its resource officer full time in said superintendent the officer provides an armed presence in the schools but has also become an important role model for students he said kids feel comfortable going to him if there are problems and been able to get out in front of potential issues or to help kids when things are happening at home not even at the school said concerns from the baltimore police department that armed school staff might be mistaken for an active shooter were one reason the district move forward with a concealed carry policy said schools often pay the salaries of resource officers but arming staff members is usually a much cheaper route as existing employees are already being paid to perform their normal duties and typically purchase their own firearms arming school staff members is a decision each district has to make based on its own needs and circumstances said dick caster the school safety and security consultant for the ohio school boards association have years in public school administration in some capacity and never did think we would be arming staff he said when you talk about arming staff its kind of chilling but you cannot not have the discussion but for hire who said he never had much of an interest in guns and whose religious beliefs align with carrying a firearm or taking a life the risk of a school shooting is just too high not to have armed staff the school also employs a resource officer come full circle to say that not going to allow someone to take someone elses life he said feel a confidence about the people that have gone through the training hire said he also got the support of the county sheriffs office before moving ahead with a policy doubt we would have done anything if we have the blessing of the sheriff he said calls to county sheriff tim rogers were not returned staff were trained by the tactical defense institute during a class with extensive exercises and training in conflict resolution medical trauma treatment and more hire said training is crucial for armed staff members to be effective said joe who runs the institute all you have to have is a concealed handgun license and permission from the school board he said but most schools realize that getting additional specialized training on these kind of events is necessary
