kansas voters will head to the polls next week to cast decisions in the presidential race legislative and judicial retention contests but they will face another choice should the state constitution include a right to hunt and fish the constitutional amendment drawn the same level of attention as other races yet supporters and opponents are battling all the same no public polling on support for the measure appears available but it passed the legislature by an overwhelming margin voters will decide whether to add a provision to the kansas constitution enshrining the right to hunt fish and trap subject to reasonable laws and regulations that promote wildlife conservation and management the amendment also states that public hunting and fishing would be a preferred means of managing and controlling wildlife if passed the amendment would effectively change nothing at least not immediately the kansas department for wildlife parks and tourism has said all current laws and regulations would still apply amendment supporters say future potential threats to hunting and fishing drive the need for the change we want to make sure we protect the ability of hunters and fishermen and others to practice their sports and we believe thats really the best way to continue our conservation efforts believe the constitutional amendment will limit those efforts in any way day chairman of the kansas state rifle association pac said day referred to efforts in other states and said the humane society of the united states is behind some of the opposition that other places have seen he called the amendment and said it will protect rights without limiting the states ability to have meaningful laws and regulations for conservation midge the kansas state director of the humane society of the united states said the wildlife department already does an excellent job in regulating appropriately the constitution is supposed to represent everyone she said but the amendment only speaks to a subset not every kansan hunts fishes or traps its geared toward a certain group a specialized group and thats not what our constitution is for by any means said according to the national conference of state legislatures states have constitutional provisions guaranteeing the right to hunt and fish language dates to the guarantees in the other states have passed since california and island have language in their constitutions guaranteeing the right to fish but not to hunt indiana voters also will decide whether to amend its constitution to include the right to hunt and fish missouri and at least five other states introduced legislation on this issue in but those measures pass the kansas amendment began as a resolution introduced in by rep adam and rep later resigned to become a lobbyist for the national rifle association lawmakers put up very little opposition this spring to the resolution it easily garnered the support needed passing the house and clearing the senate in a unanimous vote the resolution which put the amendment on the ballot had the support of the wildlife department during legislative debate the chief legal counsel before a house committee questioned whether delaying a constitutional proposal would make passing one more difficult in the future given a declining number of hunters anglers and trappers nationally to begin this issue could potentially serve as a rallying cry for fishing and trapping groups to create a cohesive group where one does not currently exist in kansas and polarize individuals who are currently indifferent to hunting fishing or trapping said additional opposition may come from individuals who view this as a firearms issue failure of such an amendment to pass may also be viewed as an endorsement of fishing and trapping agendas said she surprised by the legislative vote margin in favor of the amendment public pressure by the gun lobby may have played a role she indicated hope leveler heads will prevail but think the way they presented it the right to hunt makes it seem like taking away our rights and were not going to be able to do this anymore and thats simply not true said the of kansas which promotes conservation remains neutral on the amendment director said in a statement however that the amendment address the greatest threat to the future of hunting and fishing which he pegged as habitat loss kansas has lost more than a million acres of grassland habitat over the past years said grasslands and woodlands important for game and species continue are converted to agricultural production he said regardless of whether the amendment is approved by voters or not of kansas hopes it will be used to draw more attention to the greatest threats to hunting and fishing said we need to work together to reverse the loss of wildlife habitat and obtain protection of flows in our rivers and streams
