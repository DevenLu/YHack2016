democratic rep elijah was the ranking minority member on the house committee so he knows firsthand how republican work from up close personal experience on new day this morning he revealed the real motivation behind the fbi directors improper memo to congress last week think the american people have a clue how hard the republicans particularly on my committee have been on the fbi this is a man director who they loved they said he was the greatest thing in the world very honorable when he came out with the decision in july to not prosecute they suddenly turned against him he knows that if he makes any misstep the republicans are going to be all over him and going to try and bring harm to him the thing that he did say in our hearing and it stuck with me is that there should not be a double standard to the disadvantage of is heavily implying that the fbi director was so intimidated by congressional republicans and the threat of being dragged in front of a congressional investigation committee himself that he caved in and fed them the kind of vaguely worded red meat memo the trump campaign desperately needed to keep their failing campaign on life support even himself admitted that his memo was going to be widely misinterpreted which is probably why host began her interview with congressman by saying trump is lying about the probe it taken long for the roof to cave in on career anyway as his obvious meddling in the election has drawn bipartisan complaints about illegal electioneering by the fbi director his former boss to condemn his actions and for the senate minority leader harry to demand answers from the fbi about the republican candidates love affair with russian dictator point was not lost on the congressman from maryland who told there has been a lot of information out there about mr trump mr and the russian government and alleged attempts to take over our election members of congress have asked for months for the fbi to provide us with information if mr trump mr and any elements of the russian government have any coordination or connection with each other they have not given us one syllable so the question here is do we have a double standard here of course theres a double standard the fbi has a responsibility to keep certain things secret and when it comes to partisan elections that responsibility is key to the ability of our electoral basic functioning pointed out cogently that republican george bush was investigated by the fbi in prior to running for president yet the white house grab his fbi file and air all of the dirty laundry claiming a very partisan need for transparency during an election otherwise the fbi could decide to influence every election in america and over time the fbi would pick the elected officials to their liking nothing can the bell that fbi director struck by letting loose his vague memo but everyone can understand there is a sexist partisan and blatant double standard at play by republicans celebrating a vague memo which only happened because an official sworn to be decided he valued his political career more than the integrity of our electoral system watch it here
