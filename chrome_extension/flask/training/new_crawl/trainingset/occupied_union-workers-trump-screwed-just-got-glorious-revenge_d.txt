in a hilarious but symbolic protest of republican nominee donald trumps a culinary union in vegas is building a wall around the trump international vegas hotel this wall however is made of taco trucks the culinary union composed of primarily immigrants was born last december when striking workers at the trump hotel finally won the right to unionize and forced donald trump to pay back lost wages to the workers he illegally retaliated against during bargaining negotiations he was also accused of threatening and intimidating the organizing workers which should come as a surprise to absolutely nobody who has followed the trump campaign were reminding mr trump that immigrant workers here and across the country will be watching the debate and voting in november said political director they are joined by a number of advocacy figures and democratic activist groups including who is the democratic candidate running to depose congressman hardy were protesting donald trumps hotel here in vegas where a majority of workers voted to unionize and shamefully trump has failed to sit down at the table with them as he has demonized hispanics women veterans and the disabled we will send him and those who supported him like my opponent congressman hardy a message that were here and we vote said the union has held at least ten rallies since in protest of donald trump and his rhetoric and are now taking it a step further by constructing a wall of taco trucks around the hotel the taco truck became a symbol for the campaign after one of his more questionable surrogates warned that culture is a very dominant culture its imposing and its causing problems if you do something about it going to have taco trucks on every corner drastically underestimated americas love for tacos social media quickly turned his words into both a rally cry and a running joke and democrats began registering voters at taco trucks around the nation the demonstration by the culinary union is an incredible political stunt mocking trumps constant talk of forcing mexico to pay for a border wall and demonstrating the power of labor activism by a group of hispanic workers personally suffered under the management of the trump organization we shudder to think of what would happen to american labor power and the working classes under a president trump related items style taco trucks
