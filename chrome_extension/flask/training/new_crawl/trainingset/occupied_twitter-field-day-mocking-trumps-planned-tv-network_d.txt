republican nominee donald trump has been long rumored to be launching a news network to monetize his audience of voters after he inevitably loses this years election to democrat last night trump debuted a nightly news program from his campaign which used live to demonstrate what biased media really looks like to his audience surprisingly there was no trump on the show just a buggy program of his surrogates interviewing the top campaign communications staffer that was discovered up with the biased mainstream media at last weeks debate and others its obvious that the trump campaign is already turning to plan to try and keep their viewing audience entertained beyond the election by launching this newscast which they plan to send every night on twitter noticed the laughable production and the has been trending ever since as users react to trumps awful broadcast take a look two of the most popular shows on television yielded two of the best images of the bunch entertainment hit the nail on the head with extra style points for including this amazing video of tiffany trump artfully avoiding a kiss from her sex abusing father after his ugly performance at the second presidential debate a far more entertaining tv program would be how your mother met her my mistress telling the real story of how trump caused an in person fight between his first wife and then mistress maples which the washington post wrote about earlier this month based on a stern show recording speaking of the left coast this one seems more like a hollywood movie poster but it could work as how to lose in days which donald trump should privately worry about every time another one of his female sexual assault accusers steps forward heres a selection of the rest of the best tweets that we found in ironically revelations regarding one of trumps many failed ventures the highly sexist reality show the girls of hall just came to light the reality is that trump is only an talent for television and his lame attempt at producing his own show involved rehashing a tired concept and using it to embarrass and degrade the contestants on his show one of them nearly died during the production and it was cancelled after only eight episodes now thats a real rejected trump tv show
