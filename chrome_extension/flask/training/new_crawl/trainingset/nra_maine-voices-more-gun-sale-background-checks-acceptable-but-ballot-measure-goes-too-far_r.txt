on maine people will be asked to vote on several important ballot questions as the former chairmen of the legislatures inland fisheries and wildlife committee we would like to share some important facts about the negative effects that question would have on sportsmen and women gun safety is of the utmost importance to sportsmen and women if question were only about background checks for private gun sales we be having this intense debate over and opposition to question unfortunately this proposed law goes too far over the years sportsmen and women including the largest sporting group in the state the alliance of maine have sponsored and lobbied hard to enact some of the best legislation regarding gun safety for maine for instance sportsmen had a leading role in passing the law that allows a judge to issue temporary orders removing firearms from individuals accused of domestic violence this same measure allows law enforcement to temporarily remove firearms from an alleged domestic abuser before sportsmen pushed for this new law firearms could be taken from a domestic abuser only after a conviction except under special bail conditions in domestic violence situations the time between the temporary and final court action can be the most dangerous ironically the initiative on this falls ballot exempts firearm transfers between family members and significant others the very group most vulnerable to domestic violence from undergoing a background check another law proposed by state paul davis a member of the sam board of exposed and helped close an embarrassing and dangerous lapse in our judicial system for years the vital information about hundreds of individuals here in maine who had been adjudicated by the courts with serious mental illness a condition under which they were barred from possessing firearms was not reported to the national instant criminal background check system you heard that right maine as a state even sending this important data about the most potentially dangerous and mentally unstable people in our state to the fbi so that it could be added to the database of prohibited persons davis a retired state trooper recognized this serious hole in our public safety net and introduced legislation that provided funding to eliminate the backlog and bring the system up to date sam testified in favor of and lobbied to pass this bill finally after sam and others aggressively pressed this bill representatives of the judiciary announced they had found money to get the job done ultimately the legislation was unnecessary you may be asking yourself what sportsmen and women like about question it is not the background checks for private firearm sales it is that background checks would apply to firearm transfers which question defines as any situation in which a person furnishes gives lends delivers or otherwise provides a firearm with or without consideration the federal gun control act of exempts temporary transfers of firearms when they are for sporting purposes the federal government allows these temporary transfers because they are common practice for guides mentors and hunting companions and they are not a source of crime or illegal guns if question passes that exemption would no longer exist and the traditional relationships and the culture that has evolved around the safe use of firearms will be replaced with confusion and expensive unnecessary regulation what was once easy routine and harmless would change you could loan a firearm to a friend for hunting if you each have a background check and pay new fees you could forgo the background check only if you stay together the whole time hunting or if hunting is legal in all places where the transferee possesses the firearm neither situation is practical hunting is a solitary sport and the second condition is impossible to abide by there are hundreds of places where hunting is not legal but you can possess a firearm could loan a gun to a fellow hunter and walk through a field and up to a road its perfectly legal to cross the road but the road is not a legal hunting area therefore both hunters would be in violation we may want to walk into the woods before legal hunting time to get to our spot its perfectly legal to walk with an unloaded rifle to your hunting spot before sunrise but under this proposal both hunters would be in violation sportsmen and women take gun safety seriously unfortunately this proposal is dramatically overwritten and would do more harm to gun owners than to criminals the really ironic thing about back ground checks is that they do not stop crime did you know that the following mass murderers passed background checks and legally purchased firearms they used in their crimes killed wounded recruiting killed wounded roof african methodist episcopal church killed wounded barbara killed wounded yard killed wounded tech killed wounded hood killed lee gabby killed wounded james holmes killed even adam hook killed mother the source of his firearms passed a back ground check fbi statistics show that the majority of stopped sales by the are later reversed because of either inaccurate information in the system or that the person stopped was not the person in the system but shared something that triggered the stoppage like a name not all of the records in the system are specific enough to zero in on a specific individual terrorist watch lists are even worse in this regard check out the aclu another statistic that is telling are the very few than prosecutions that result from these stopped sales an argument can be made that this statistic is proof of the administrations desire to prove the laws work so as to push for more restrictions but that argument also supports the view that better enforcement would show that what is already in place may be sufficient started to read this article because believe that gun control is an important way to protect society but this law is not feasible but once knew that the authors were once on the committee lost all interest in what they had to say was not aware that my disdain for that unlawful entity had grown to such a degree that now believe everyone that has ever been associated with is tainted intellect tells me this is not true but the failure of our law enforcement community and elected officials to deal with their unlawful civil rights violating policies and continued prosecution of charges using entrapment techniques is disturbing now am thinking that perhaps this is a good law after all if does not like it it must be in the best interest of the citizens originally asked what crimes your family members plead guilty to that they do said found guilty your reply was about one person not sure which one of the many referring to do know that most took a plea agreement which includes pleading guilty to something while other charges are thrown out assume from your comment that the one person you are talking about plead guilty to one charge while the other charges were thrown out you said that he plead guilty to the one crime he did do he was found guilty of that one crime while he was not convicted on the other unless those other are still hanging over his head and were not part of the plea pretty rare that the would arrange a plea agreement on only some of the charges against a person assuming that the charges where thrown out that would make my statement correct reading these posts its easy to get the impression that we have any laws at all since not everyone will obey them no more speed limits because someone will always speed what really stands out is that because of the inconvenience to the roughly of who hunt the rest of the population must continue to be exposed to risk for the record have firearms which loan out because ultimately am responsible for whatever harm they may cause since have nothing to hide comfortable with background checks will it stop everyone who have a gun from getting one of course not no law ever does but it will stop virtually anyone from buying a firearm from uncle henrys or at a gun show without some kind of approval really lets say this joke passes and decide to buy a gun from someone selling in uncle henrys or at a gun show what is going to make the seller and me go to an to have the check run absolutely nothing ill be able to give him the money then there and we both go our separate ways if were both cool with that and nobody will ever know the may do it purely as a move but if they theres no mechanism in place to catch them see when a check is run the only info sent to is the buyers identification further id such as is optional and whether the gun is a long gun or handgun the will write the firearm info on the but that stays with the dealer if question were only about background checks for private gun sales we be having this intense debate over and opposition to question unfortunately this proposed law goes too far because many of good will are willing to consider some reforms to our gun laws as long as they are fair targeted protect privacy and are be addressed the maine realistically criminals are about as likely to comply with this proposal as they would the referendum require that private sellers prepare and privately keep a simple private gun sales form with pertinent details buyer contact info make and serial number of gun and statement signed by buyer to effect that they are not a prohibited its when you find out just how many denials turn out to be improper the denied person prohibited from buying or possessing a gun the false denial rate is over in many years and out of the legitimate denials only a very small percentage are ever brought to trial why is this simply by trying to buy a gun as a prohibited person committing a felony felonies actually falsifying a and trying to buy a gun if they actually touched the gun a single round of ammo yet the overwhelming majority of legitimate denials never go to trial and of those that do only a small percentage are convicted one aspect that this article did not address is that the forms and procedure the proposal requires for borrowing a firearm actually results in far as the government is concerned a permanent transfer or a sale for no compensation absent a notarized letter of agreement outlining the provisions of the loan the owner has no legal recourse to regain his property if for some obscure reason the ownership becomes contested
