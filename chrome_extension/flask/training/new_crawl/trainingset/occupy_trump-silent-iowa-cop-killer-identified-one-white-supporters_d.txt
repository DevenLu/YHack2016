during the middle of the night the city of des in iowa was rocked with violence as a man opened fire on police officers in ambush style killing two the suspect is a white male as per police reports and has just been taken into custody what we do know about this man is that his mind is a whirlwind of hatred and hypocrisy he was kicked out of a football game in october for waving a confederate flag at football players kneeling during the national anthem in protest of police violence against blacks was offended by the blacks sitting through our anthem thousands more whites fought and died for their freedom however this is not about the armed forces they are cop haters said in a rant tinged with white nationalist themes three weeks before he would ambush two policemen in their patrol car and killing them both the trump camp is silent as a man who supports him embarks on an act of violence that trump himself has been calling for the muted response is infuriating especially for the blacks and muslims of america who have been demonized by for trying to stop profiling and ask they be given the benefit of the doubt that white americans get why does the media refuse to call this what it is terrorism where was radicalized why wont donald trump say radical white terrorism is he part of a larger white supremacist terror group we need to put a stop to white men entering this country until we can figure out what the hell is going on sound familiar while civic institutions like black lives matter and the council of relations are smeared as terror groups for daring to ask some uncomfortable questions and demanding that the rights bestowed upon the american people are enforced equally for all her citizens the real terror threat as confirmed by the fbi no less comes from white conservatives related items style trump white killer white power
