the wheels are falling off donald trumps flailing campaign and national political director jim murphy just took a surprise step back from his duties just days before the election murphy was the primary liaison between the trump campaign and the republican national committee in charge of field operations george noticed and his sarcastic response sliced rapidly through twitter this latest defection from the trump campaign leaves the donald without his most experienced party insider as the longtime republican operative jumps ship before the coming blue wave election jim murphy was known as paul right hand man which is why he took over ground operations of the campaign when trump campaign manager number two departed under a massive cloud of serious allegations of wrongdoing as a lobbyist and political operative in ukraine obviously move was in direct response to last nights debate conclusion where trump repudiated american democracy which fox news even called political suicide however murphy may have ulterior motives for leaving so soon that have less to do with trumps debate performance and more to do with his less than stellar job performance as late as labor day the republican presidential campaign only had one office in florida while democratic nominee had already opened campaign offices the mainstream media taken too much time to closely look at those offices but initial reports seem to show that the republican campaign is going to be as politically effective as trump university worked to teach people how to get rich quick a named scott decided to go deep undercover as a volunteer at three different trump offices in arizona california and florida only to find after much searching just to find the offices very little actual activity until the trump tapes landed and everything began deteriorating rapidly from there day after day the excuses for the lack of bodies started to pile up ranging from republicans were too busy because they had jobs to hurricane imminent arrival but the hurricane came and went with nary a raindrop in tampa and the infamous access hollywood tape dropped the office now came to a complete halt only now college football and the great weather were to blame for lack of turnout not the fact that well you trump was just caught admitting that he had sexually assaulted god knows how many women yet on my last night in tampa attended the debate viewing party at the and support was robust where the hell were all these people during the week and the only one asking that question as the debate ended two staff members even scolded them for their lack of support say do it and do it it cant be left up to a few people got to do their part the following day said my goodbyes to the staff but not before peeking inside an empty phone bank to see those calls for support were still going unanswered and it was clear to me these people cared more about the reality show trump had created then the reality of the campaign itself no wonder paul right hand man needed to bolt before the returns arrive because theres no way that the way jim murphy has been driving this trump train that its going to be making any stops in washington next year donald trump is about to head into a national general election with a skeleton chain of campaign offices run by scant volunteers and centered around entertaining his voters with a string of train wrecks on television but at least he wont have to fire his national political director when the election ends
