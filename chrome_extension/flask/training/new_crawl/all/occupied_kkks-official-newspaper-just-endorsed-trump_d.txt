as anchor scott once observed to republican presidential nominee donald trumps face during an interview you love hearing about yourself it is oxygen to you trump responded in his typical braggart manner that he has been on the cover of more publications than any and that he enjoys hanging the covers on his office wall as trophies because they are cheaper than wallpaper cheap and tacky thats quintessential trump however trump likely wont be adorning his wall with the latest edition of the crusader the official newspaper of the who just put trump on their cover with a glowing endorsement of his candidacy with a promise of a resurgence of white supremacy the publication in part wrote make america great again it is a slogan that has been repeatedly used by donald trump in his campaign for the presidency you can see it on the shirts buttons posters and ball caps such as the one being worn here by trump speaking at a recent can it happen can america really be great again this is what we will soon found out while trump wants to make america great again we have to ask ourselves what made america great in the first place the short answer to that is simple america was great not because of what our forefathers did but because of who are forefathers were america was founded as a white christian republic and as a white christian republic it became great the trump campaign will likely not accept the crusaders endorsement but considering trumps plummeting poll numbers anything is possible however that does not mean the trump campaign is going to repudiate the crusader or the either we know this based on how trump has treated his racist sycophants in the past in february when trump was asked about the endorsement he received from david duke the former imperial wizard of the trump said know anything about what even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacist so know know trump continued know nothing about david duke know nothing about white supremacists relive that precious moment below those comments sparked outrage and days later trump blamed his answer on technical difficulties by saying was sitting in a house in florida with a bad earpiece right to believe trump in cahoots with white supremacists is not in line with reality for example trump has personally at least posts directly from other white supremacists the republican leadership accepts the white supremacist support for their standard bearer and during trumps acceptance speech of the nomination at the republican national convention they put the twitter comments of a known racist on four large screens in the arena for all to see trump even accepted one of americas most famous racists william johnson as an official delegate in california johnson is the leader of the american freedom party which exists to represent the political interests of white americans to bring up david duke again the former leader has credited trump for increasing his chances at winning a vacant senate seat in louisiana duke said the fact that donald trumps doing so well it proves that winning am winning curiously duke who has made a living out of hating black people has about double the support of black voters than trump does pointed out that this portion of voters could be a wild card for trump in general election the threat of the white supremacist fascist voting bloc is not to be taken lightly considering trump has alienated every minority community he only has ignorant hateful and afraid white people left to count upon
