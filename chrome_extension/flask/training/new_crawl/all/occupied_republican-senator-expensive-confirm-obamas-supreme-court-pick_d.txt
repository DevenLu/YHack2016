republicans have forced the united states supreme court to work for most of and now the iowa senator in charge of the judicial committee just said that hearings would not be worthwhile in evaluating president nominee garland to fill the courts current vacancy it has left the supreme court deadlocked on many decisions since they lack the deciding vote of a ninth member republican senator chuck had the nerve to blame the senates inaction and their dereliction of their constitutional duty on the cost of holding hearings speaking to the des reviews editorial board said sure sure suppose the tradition is and not sure would follow this tradition because know who have on my staff know how deep you have to go into going through a persons record in order to hold a hearing thats worthwhile and so you appropriate you get special not appropriations you get special from the rules committee additional money to hire additional legal people my staff tells me thats about a half a million to to hire people to maybe work for three or four months to do it and so when senators say they going to take it up should spend that money and have a hearing president final appointee garland is considered a centrist pick not very liberal and more conservative on issues of criminal justice than most of his party would prefer but due to republican obstruction death has left the longest vacancy on the high court since the late and the waiting period for garlands nomination is now the longest in american history if you combine logic with what arizona john threats to block all of nominations to the supreme court if elected then it really seems obvious why she and president have made a major pivot to help candidates this week the white house press secretary responded thusly the american people have actually hired already senators to fulfill their basic responsibility and that basic responsibility is to give a fair hearing to the presidents nominee to the supreme court so senator is wrong when he says that the american people cant afford to hold those hearings the truth is the american people and the people of iowa cant afford to be paying the salary of a senator not doing his job and chairman has not been doing his job congressional republicans never spare any expense when it comes to say investigating but they now claim to be pinching pennies by denying one of the most important constitutionally mandated officers a judge no less his public hearing in front of the formerly worlds greatest deliberative body considering their recent admission that they may intend to permanently filibuster the supreme court if given seats in the senate during this years election president start considering a legal maneuver to seize upon a constitutional ambiguity like this one described by a member of common cause to fill the court after the election is decided the republicans are defending incumbent seats this year and if people want to have a functioning court system the only choice will be democrats turn iowa blue toss out this obstructionist and support chuck opponent democrat patty judge here heres the interview
