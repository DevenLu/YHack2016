famous musician tore into republican nominee donald trump today in an published in magazine tearing into the racist with unrepentant fury tired of being a lefty who has to respect other peoples opinions writes trump is an actual sociopath distraught at the unrelenting vitriol being hurled at democratic nominee disparages the naivete with which he feels many voters are approaching the election if you have a a jill stein supporter but they were nine when ralph handed the presidency to george bush they know better there are a lot of people who have lived in a relatively benign bubble like young women who just assume that roe wade will always be the law of the land think that theres an innocence that is informing a lot of peoples desire not to vote or to vote for jill stein but its because had eight years of and think that that innocence is making some of them naive and delusional think there is something seriously broken inside him where an actual sociopath and on the spectrum pretty close to being a psychopath done nothing to indicate that even capable of feeling empathy anyone except for himself trump presidency would be death by republican cuts it basically gives the the ability to write gun policy it gives the coal industry and the oil industry the ability to write energy policy its handing the keys to people who want to advance policy measures that are just again try and be diplomatic but trying to advance policy measures to protect their corporate interests or protect their personal interests but to the egregious detriment of our country with trump you get a belligerent racist most likely a sociopath definitely a racist and misogynist with no governing experience and with you get an incredibly bright progressive strong experienced legislator theres no choice unless ignorant delusional or racist absolutely right on that point while the death by republican cuts is the threat posed by any republican candidate for the presidency the figure of donald trump is a threat to our republic as we know it and there can be only one choice given more money to democrats this cycle than ever given in an election season done tweeted and probably to my own personal detriment the detriment of my friendships certainly the detriment of my professional life but honestly the results of this election are more important than most id rather lose fans and have a hand in trying to keep donald trump out of the white house than trying to protect a career a career pales in comparison to the health and wellbeing of our country and our planet what learned a long time ago is if a public figure and opinionated and outspoken people will hate you for it even if they agree with what saying but its really nice been doing this for a long time and at this point just care whats someone do not buy my records its no one buys records anyway
