ever since republican nominee donald trumps penchant for sexual assault was revealed in a hot moment his many victims have stepped forward to air their grievances his fourteenth accuser porn star drake just dropped a bombshell revealing that donald trump solicited her to have sex for money shortly after marrying trump and around the same time as his infamous trump tapes episode with billy bush today drake held a press conference with famous lawyer gloria to relay her story of donald trump and his henchmen aggressively soliciting her for sexual favors even after she declined him trump personally called her before following with an offer and a flight on his private jet if shed only go to his room for sex which she declined drake looking for any money but told her story at the press conference ten years ago was working for wicked pictures an adult film company at a golf tournament in lake the adult entertainment actress said during the press conference was at booth when met donald trump in the celebrity gift room early in the morning before he teed off he flirted with me and invited me to walk along the golf course with him which did during that time he asked me for my phone number which gave to him later that evening he invited me to his room said feel right going alone so two other women came with me in the penthouse suite met donald again drake continued when we entered the room he grabbed each of us tightly in a hug and kissed each one of us without asking permission he was wearing pajamas a bodyguard was also present he asked me about details on my job as an adult film star about shooting porn and he also asked us about our personal relationships and whether we were married or single we answered his questions it felt like an interview about or minutes later we left his room drake then says she returned to her bedroom when she received a call from a man asking for her on trumps behalf he said donald wanted me to come back upstairs to suite she explained indicated did not wish to return then donald called he asked me to return to his suite and have dinner with him he also invited me to a party declined donald then asked me what do you want how much told him that because had to return to for work said that as an excuse because want him to continue asking me and want to be with him after that received another call from either donald or a male calling on his behalf offering me declined again and once more gave as an excuse that had to return to angeles for work was then told mr trump would allow me to use his private jet only if accepted his private invitation the actress continued did relay my experiences immediately afterwards to some friends out of respect to the other parties involved and their families will not share their names am choosing to share my personal exchange in light of the recently released tapes in order to lend my voice my strength and my support to the other women who are coming forward theres even a photograph of the republican candidate posing with the adult actress at the tournament as we all know trump actively looked for extramarital relations shortly after his elaborate wedding to trump at this suggests that the new york developer was talking about himself in this famous column by new york times columnist when he described rich men with private jets who have trouble finding women to have sexual relations collectively his words and his actions are a huge testament to his character that of uncontrollable entitlement misogyny and a sexual assault apologist this is not acceptable behavior for anyone much less a presidential candidate realize that in the situation may be but a tiny grain of sand but clearly this is an enormous speech am not looking for monetary compensation do not need additional fame or the type of attention that this is sure to bring understand that may be called a liar or an opportunist but will risk that in order to stand in solidarity with women who share similar accounts that span many many years donald trumps campaign responded yet to the most recent allegations though the republican did make a major speech today which broached the topic of women accusing him sexual assaults and impropriety trump fantasized in the speech about suing all of the women accusing him of sexual misconduct in his first days in office gloria issued a terse statement to the donald explaining that an army of lawyers would rise up to defend trumps accusers from his frivolous litigation if he dares to lash out again at the women he sexually abused notably this is the first time the republican nominee has been accused of soliciting sex for money instead of assaulting women before they could see him coming sadly this probably will not be the last press conference where a woman steps forward to accuse donald trump of sexual misconduct this week or before the general election only days away
