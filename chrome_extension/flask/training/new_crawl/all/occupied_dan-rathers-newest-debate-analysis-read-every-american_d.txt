legendary journalist dan rather shared his thoughts on tonights presidential debate in a post on that quickly took off through social media in these dark times of contempt where the truth is malleable and the hearts of americans are full of frustration and anger calm and thoughtful analysis is needed more than ever he writes suspect the headline out of tonight may very well be donald trumps refusal to guarantee that he will accept the decision of the voters on november it is a horrifying and betrayal of the norms of american politics but it was just one part of a this final debate in a campaign that seems to be firmly in the twilight zone this is not what our democracy should be but it is where we are today wonder if many minds were changed doubt it has been judged the winner of the first two debates tonight many felt trump needed a knockout to get back in the race but think this was best performance perhaps by far think she wanted this to be a preview of her presidency her tone was the most straightforward and direct have yet seen she try to run away from her policy expertise she embraced it it was as if she was saying am here am smart am qualified will not be intimidated or silenced and am ready to be president the format of tonights debate favored depth over breadth on the number of topics this meant that a lot of important issues were left unquestioned but the benefit was that the able moderator could drill down to real policy with the most important quality of an interviewer the follow up question and he used it to good effect there has been a silly trope floating around the coverage of the campaign about many critics have claimed that the very notion is sexist agree yet tonight seemed to throw those worries aside there were fewer anecdotal flights of storytelling about her interactions with average families that you often hear about on the stump was steely determined forceful think this will be the tone of her presidential face and think it is one she wears well and naturally hit trump hard on issue after issue with knowledge and facts on russia the supreme court nuclear weapons immigration and the list goes on you could disagree with her on policy but you cant question whether she knows what shes talking about one big line that think will play on was in the dust up over russia who would have thought that years after the end of the cold war the specter of russia would loom over and american presidential campaign but there you have it when the discussion turned to and who was responsible for the hack trump disagreeing with the assessment of the intelligence agencies said we know who is behind it fired back he would rather believe than the military professionals and intelligence officials its a line you could expect from ronald reagan by contrast trump has been skating through the campaign on buzzwords and applause lines that fire up his base tonight the format asked for more substance and he struggled he often left topics dangling meandered through sentences and fumbled with thoughts that went nowhere all lines of thoughts wavering in the wind often his most cogent statements were cheap shots when he would stop talking sometimes had to ask myself what was he talking about trumps millions of eager followers will continue to cheer as the majority of americans seem to be turning the page on this ugly campaign they have seen all they need from trump and they have had enough there was many lines from this debate that could make for powerful campaign ads but am not sure she will need them trump may not agree to abide by the results of the election but hopefully the rest of the country can act with a bit more maturity and decency
