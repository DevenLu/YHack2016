a fifth woman has come forward to tell her traumatic story of assault at donald trumps hands tonight and it is extremely disturbing and paints donald trump not just as a serial philander but a man for whom attempted rape is an extremely easy crime for him to commit while interviewing donald trump and his pregnant wife about how happy their marriage was at their estate at people magazine reporter was invited by donald trump to tour the mansion with him while was upstairs changing for the trump led her around the obscenely decadent mansion and led her into a tremendous room where he assaulted her almost immediately echoing the tale told by makeup artist jill we walked into that room alone and trump shut the door behind us turned around and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat now a tall strapping girl who grew up wrestling two giant brothers even once sparred with mike it takes a lot to push me but trump is much looming he was fast taking me by surprise and throwing me off balance was stunned and was grateful when trumps longtime butler burst into the room a minute later as tried to unpin myself the butler announced that trump would be downstairs soon and sat down with trump who then told her this you know were going to have an affair you he declared in the same confident tone he uses when he says going to make america great again have you ever been to peter for steaks ill take you were going to have an affair telling you he also referenced the infamous cover of the new york post during his affair with maples you remember he said best sex ever had walked in just then serene and glowing donald instantly reverted back to doting husband mode as if nothing had happened and we continued our interview about their wedded bliss nodded at his hollow words and smiled at his jokes but was nauseated it seem to register to him in the slightest that what done might have hurt or offended me or his wife then describes her abject fear at attending an appointment at the spa and accidentally ended up arriving late where she was told that mr trump had been waiting for her in the massage room she obviously cut the session short and left as quickly as she could its very clear at this point that donald trump is a serial sexual predator and been doing this for decades his victims likely number in the tens already identified eleven women he has improperly proposition as more women come forward the rest will find the courage to do so as well they will find strength in numbers and the heinous crimes of trump will be laid bare for all the world to see
