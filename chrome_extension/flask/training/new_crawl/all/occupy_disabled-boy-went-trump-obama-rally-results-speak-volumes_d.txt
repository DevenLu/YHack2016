on tuesday our nation is going to the polls to make a very important choice we will not just choose who will lead our nation for the next four years we will make a statement about what kind of nation we are and decide what kind of nation we want to be in the future and with that in mind let us present with the story of a young boy with cerebral palsy as recounted by the florida press secretary of for america today was hands down the best day of my time in the campaign no words can even but will try yesterday a reporter called me in tears after witnessing a old suffering from extreme cerebral palsy get kicked out of a donald trump rally he had told his mother that he wanted to stand up for the disability community so he asked to be taken to a trump rally was terrified about what trumps america would mean for people like him so he unable to vote but possessing the bravery to still make his voice heard was determined to go and protest once there did a simple quiet but defiant act he held up a placard immediately the crowd started chanting usa usa usa if this had anything to do with or perhaps he was for being and trump pointed to security and ordered them to get them as secret service escorted his mother and two sisters trump supporters shouted obscenities and even kicked his wheelchair what kind of nation do we live in while listening to this story freeze first in disbelief and next feeling utterly helpless what the hell could do to make this child even slightly forget that experience a nobody tell the reporter to share my number with mother and that the only thing can do is escort them into president rally the following day no chance for vip treatment and much less to meet the president this morning mother calls me and asks if my promise of getting them into the event is realistic she wanted to be extra cautious before sharing the news with said yes can get them in but thats it as arrive at the venue hours before the start of the show pace around the stadium examining routes to wheel into the vip area the zone was too far from the stage and wanted to be as close as possible conspire with my colleague johnson and we start devising a plan mother calls me to tell me arrived once greet her huddle the family to go over the course of action we needed to swim through a sea full of people cross muddy turf and then break through another wall of people to finally settle in the vip area then it was mission on all political staffer knows the attitude one needs to put on to escort a so turned my mode on walked in front of the wheel chair and began asking folks to please break away overly assertive and resolute to get to his spot we were able to hike across the field and settle into the target zone mission accomplished until of course my mind begins to race again pace back and forth as swift through mundane work right then and there decide to go rouge immediately a friend that knew could help and told him the story he asked if someone had reported on it one first listens with disbelief and forward him a not much pick up from the press point to him where in the vip area is sitting with the hope that when would work the somehow remember story and spend two extra seconds with him and with that was satisfied with was to be accomplished a handshake mission ii accomplished so sneak out of the stadium speech in order to avoid the traffic shortly after colleagues begin to frantically text and call me to tell me my friend from the was looking for me sprint about half a mile back into the stadium and push my way through angry secret service agents and thick crowds finally spot my friend who once again asks me to point out where the boy is sitting which do then out of the blue tell him well how about wheel him out of the vip area and bring him around my friend thinks about it for a second looks around for other accomplices and nods his head with approval run back into the crowd and to the vip section once again enlist and together we swim into a sea of people to wheel out through the turf and finally reach my friend who escorts us to the other side of the barricades wow this is really happening at that moment mom tells him going to meet the president the rest is jumps out of his seat and erupts into his smile almost bursting out of his face his body overcome by light when just the day before it almost succumbed to hate the rest of the story is explained by the pictures below my lesson always have the courage to do what feels right the universe will always conspire days all seen over and over again the footage of donald trump mocking a disabled reporter its become one of the defining images of this campaign a buffoon so crude and he would openly mock the man for daring to speak out against him like a child on the playground that is what donald trump represents hatred bullying intolerance and the democrats represent a vision of a different america an america which embraces all of its children no matter their ability race sexuality gender or other social constructs that we use to define ourselves
