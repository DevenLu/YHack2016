a terrorist plot to bomb an apartment building in kansas was halted by the fbi when three men were arrested on friday october who have all been charged with conspiring to use weapons of mass destruction unfortunately for zealots this incident will not be music to their ears as the individuals who were arrested are all white fringe lunatics who sought to blow up an apartment building housing refugees from somalia the individuals in question allen patrick stein and wright all belong to a group called the crusaders and have been accused of attempting to target a community of around immigrants who all lived in the same apartment building that included a mosque the plan by the despicable conservatives was to load numerous vehicles with explosives and then to park them on the four corners of the building before detonation to ensure as much destruction as possible the terrorists planned to do this the day after election day of which they believed donald trump would win the presidency to send a message to the rest of america to wake people up according to acting attorney tom beyond attacking innocent the group also considered attacking various government officials who had supported the community apparently the fbi had been on to the terrorists for over eight months as they conducted an investigation with included sending in undercover agents to infiltrate their despicable community which described as a hidden culture of hatred and violence lead fbi investigator in charge of the operation jackson said these individuals had desire the means and the capability and were committed to carrying out this act of domestic terrorism while the initial plot has been stopped the fbi refused to comment on other individuals our fringe groups which had been connected to the plot as they say the investigation and is still ongoing all three men are presently being held without bail and if convicted will all be facing life sentences the incident is another in a long line of terror plots concocted by scared white people who believe america is being overrun by immigrants who do not look like them they believed ignorantly the best way to combat the very real threat of terrorism was to become terrorists themselves so they could point out their diabolical fingers and find affirmation in their world view such a warped pathology is difficult to imagine for a rational thinking individual and the data available does not support what these individuals believe to be true a study by a think tank in washington new america concluded that since militia groups have killed more people in the united states than islamic terrorists have there have been nine attacks that killed individuals launched by those seeking to create a jihad in the united states while terrorists have launched attacks that have killed individuals on american soil furthermore the triangle center on terrorism and homeland security surveyed law enforcement groups in america and concluded facts matter to these people and most if not all of them are too far gone to see they have become exactly what they fear become oblivious to their own dangerous hypocrisy and that should concern every thinking member of american society
