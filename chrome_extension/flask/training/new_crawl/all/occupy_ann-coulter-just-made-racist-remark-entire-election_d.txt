strident fascist matriarch ann coulter just blasted out one of the most heinous examples of naked racism in the entire election which began on a low note twelve months ago with donald trumps mexicans are rapists comments and descended into the sewers from there coulters tweet is a perfect illustration of the racism that animates the trump campaign shes proposing a revival of the reviled grandfather laws which southern states passed in the to exclude black people from voting the central irony to coulters baldly racist plan to purge americas voters of anyone who wont vote nativist is that it would exclude the very person her party is running for president from the voting booth thats right donald trumps grandfather was born in germany and settled in the united states after being deported from his home country of germany for dodging the draft just so you know this proves that politics is all about skin color to ann coulter and her worshippers who support donald trump this is the naked truth as said by republican most public author who wishes latinos could be excluded from the polls today for racial reasons even the normally reserved news reporter bump of the washington post condemned coulters savagely racist tweet in a news story ann coulter rarely rises to the level of deserving serious attention and am very open to the argument that this is not one of those moments but a tweet she offered on monday night hours before election day polls opened across the country offers some insight into the composition of the united states and into its history also its gross and deserves to be identified as such one new york times editor shrewdly pointed out the similarity between coulters grandfather law dreams and the laws which were passed in nazi germany to determine citizenship based on race or ethnicity sadly republicans have sold their souls and their party to racist ignorant trolls like ann coulter the grand old party of lincoln which fought a civil war to keep americas union intact and to end the tyranny of racial slavery has become that which it was born to oppose this is rock bottom
