as the dust of the presidential election settled the tyrants in moscow were busy congratulating themselves on a job well done for months the kremlin has denied having meddled in the american election by hacking the servers of the democratic national committee and the campaign even as the evidence has mounted with their man now headed for the white house however the russians have finally owned up to their interference a political analyst with tight ties to inner circle gave a remarkably candid interview to the guardian today in which he suggested that russia was indeed behind the hacks after all while denying any direct russian interference in the election he said that maybe we helped a bit with also detailed precisely what is looking to gain from a trump presidency saying that it would limit american backing for the junta in ukraine and increase the chances of cooperation in syria the junta of course refers to the democratic government in kiev that has been resisting increasingly expansionist tendencies in the region and any negotiations with russia in syria would inevitably lead to the continuation of the rule of president in the wake of trumps election russian oligarchs were also jubilant that american sanctions imposed on the country after its illegal annexation of crimea in would soon be lifted indeed trumps shocking embrace of the brutal russian dictatorship has been driven largely by his monetary ties to the cartel of oligarchs that essentially runs moscow trump and his campaign are so thoroughly in bed with the russian elite that the fbi is now investigating former campaign manager paul ties to the oligarchs it is certainly a cruel irony that for all trumps militant chauvinism he has so totally kowtowed to russia and was helped into office by the kremlin itself in an unprecedented stain on the independence of american democracy hopefully the federal investigation of trumps russia ties will only widen as new information comes to light
