pop star better known as lady gaga called out trump on twitter today for fridays pandering speech in which the former model railed against a social media culture that was too mean and too tough it is never ok when a girl or boy is mocked bullied or attacked it is terrible when it happens on the playground and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the we have to find a better way to talk to each other said somehow with a straight face the media and the nation at large immediately seized on the incredible hypocrisy of the statement considering that her husband republican nominee donald trump has made bullying a central tenet of his appalling campaign of bigotry from insulting his sexual assault accusers for being not pretty enough for him to molest to calling former miss universe winner a disgusting con and telling his supporters to check out her sex tape does not exist for the trump has bullied everyone and everything that has stood against him the new york times even has a list of people places and things that trump has insulted on twitter and thats from january so it is extremely appropriate for lady gaga to call her out on trumps preferred insulting platform of choice
