at the third and final debate in vegas tonight trump proved his incompetence in front of the nation on top of affirming that he has no clear ideas on policy or how to run this country he also demonstrated not for the final time that he is a unapologetic misogynist on top of all of his ridiculous comments about bodies the sexual assault accusations against him and confirmed accounts of walking in on teenagers changing his lowest moment came as he called such a nasty woman with a lowered voice as she was in front of the entire country in this moment trumps true feelings on women could not have come across any him and men like him women should be seen and not heard they should only be seen until he wants to look at them guessing for trump this is from about age to and after this there is no place for women in trumps world they should be discarded kicked out and replaced on to the next wife as talked about raising taxes on the wealthy and then empowering women through the affordable care act trump attempted to overpower her with aggression saying such a nasty woman in a dejected two separate occasions the comment was uttered in a similar way with which he repeated it is so sad or so bad throughout the night in response to everything from the economy to immigration donald trump is the mosquito in americas ear his blatant disrespect of women is something we need to keep in check his brand of misogyny threatens to spill over into policy taking rights away from all women and setting us back years america was this is the crux of trump and why we need to fear all candidates like him he threatens to take control of a womans right to choose with blanket statements and scare tactics as though abortions happen four days before birth his followers and the men who think like him are unable to see things beyond black and white or nasty women and sweet ones unable to compete fairly with as he cannot match her record or begin to approach her intellect trump reverts to schoolyard bullying tactics hurling insults that would be considered below the belt in any forum let alone a national debate and as he is a disenfranchised male powerless to his own his only approach is to claim the election is rigged woe is trump his other idea call such a nasty woman because he cannot match her because he does not want to have sex with her and because she is beating him fair and square trump is the little boy on the playground losing to a girl and calling her not as lighthearted as that calling such a nasty woman not to mention interrupting her was meant to throw her off her game that comment was a blatant disrespect of all women everywhere it is the digs like that that to me even more than the pussy grabbing he is outwardly hateful towards women trump is in crisis mode as he should be there is no way that american women men are going to stand ideally by as his rhetoric of where a woman belongs or how a woman should behave go unchecked he just think is nasty he thinks all women not kissing up to him letting him kiss them without their consent are nasty the camp and the women is not going to let trumps insults go quietly in a genius turn of events the campaign immediately bought the site which redirects to official by the term nasty and women everywhere are asserting that casual sexist lingo is not okay no mr trump you cannot call nasty or insult justice just because she spoke out against you if these are the nasty women in america it goes without saying with them related items style trump
