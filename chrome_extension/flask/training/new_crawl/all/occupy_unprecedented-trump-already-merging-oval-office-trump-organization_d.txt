republican trump just named his three oldest children to the presidential transition teams executive committee putting the government of our nation directly involved with the trump organization at no time during the campaign did trump mention placing his immediate family into an official role let alone having input in the selection of high level federal political appointees political watchdogs are up in arms about the blatant mixture of trumps personal financial interests and government a day after trumps lawyer michael cohen announced that trumps three oldest children donald and would control what he labeled a blind trust for the the trump campaign announced friday afternoon that all three would also serve on trumps presidential transition team executive committee in that role the trio will have input when it comes to the people trump picks for key administration posts watchdogs who were critical of trumps blind trust in the first place say this proves that the lines between president trump and his money will be too fuzzy under this setup the fact that they have been included as part of the transition team just shows how inappropriate their role in bridging the gap between him as a businessman and politician is said a strategic adviser at the campaign legal center its a clear demonstration that there is no between the two and others have also cast doubt on the idea that the blind trust is actually blind at all she calls it a trust normally high ranking government officials place their assets into blind trust so they do not know what investments they own to avoid conflict of interest in making decisions but family members share the same interests as trump and placing his children in charge of the family business means there is nothing blind at all about the financial interests politico reported that the official transition read more like a pitch for the trump organization than a government though some of the sales language has since been removed trumps transition web site illustrates the difficulty in separating the future president from the brand that bears his name his biography extols the prestigious addresses and premier golf clubs the mogul currently owns in new york city and around the world the trump signature is synonymous with the most prestigious addresses in the world it says voters chose donald trump to fight corruption and responded by hiring a team of corporate lobbyists to staff his administration and by turning the oval office and numerous executive branch roles in our federal government into another wing of his real estate businesses theres nothing in criminal law to stop donald trump from making conflicted decisions as president
