one of donald trumps top wall street campaign advisers just compared president rules requiring honest financial dealing to slavery and promised that the republican campaign would repeal the key initiative by the current democratic administration intended to protect the life savings of americas retirees from unsavory financial advisers shamefully his position is mainstream political thought and even one of house speaker paul major initiatives to fight poverty just cannot make this stuff up by letting fraudulent financial advisers continue to prey upon the innocent reports were going to repeal it anthony said on the sidelines of the securities enforcement forum in washington last week it could be the dumbest decision to come out of the government in the last to years in an aside mr compared the rule to an supreme court ruling which held that african americans were not citizens its about like the scott decision mr said the new rules protect responsible americans saving for retirement and elderly pensioners from being lied to by unscrupulous advisers who bilk a staggering billion dollars out of our retirees by steering them into savings plans after president implemented the important new federal regulation this year he imposed fiduciary duty on financial advisers which means they must advance clients savings needs first and foremost above their own personal financial gain it seems like something so basic so obvious that it been in place for years but until the implemented this rule investment advisers had no fiduciary duty to clients and these advisers ripped off millions of americans annually mr just kidding about his slavery argument and decided that a level playing field for people who thought their financial advisers were actually helping them save is discriminatory and said so in a to the department of labor has made a decision to discriminate against a class of people who they deem to be adding no value he wrote they are judging what should happen in a free market and attempting to put financial advisers out of work when market forces cyclically adjust again they will be having congressional hearings about how big the mistake was to do this its important to note that the republican party agrees strongly with policy and would have repealed president rules had he not smacked them down with the veto hammer when republicans tried to override the veto in congress thats when democrats held a which disrupted the house of representatives after the refused to even hold a vote on new gun control measures in the wake of the pulse nightclub shooting republican leadership has been nothing short of abysmal since the rise of trump but house speaker paul failure to lead stands out because of his reputation for making big plans for america heres big completely damaging plan to fight elderly poverty specifically and the would like to abolish the department of labors recently released fiduciary rule which once its fully implemented in will simply require that investment professionals act in their clients best interests when offering advice on their retirement accounts you may be shocked to discover that this is in fact a new thing but traditionally advisers have been permitted to consider their own bottom lines when deciding where to steer their clients money so long as the investments are suitable to the customers needs thats left the door open for massive and costly conflicts of interest in the name of fighting poverty and encouraging upward mobility paul and the house want to make it easier for financial advisers to screw over their clients theres a direct and recent parallel in americas financial history upon which as an author can give expert commentary a licensed mortgage broker and my profession had the same fiduciary responsibilities legislated after the financial crisis can confirm without a doubt fiduciary duty in the professional finance fields is not slavery the reality is that owing the fiduciary responsibility to my clients is a tremendous reassurance everyone working with me who know must do my best to benefit their needs over my own its also been a boon to the professionalism level of the entire field of mortgage brokerage in fact as a mortgage broker we have a higher level of responsibility to our clients than the actual banks or lenders do themselves but theres a lot fewer mortgage brokers now that honest dealing is mandatory and a lot of financial advisers who broker retirement savings plans may have to exit the business as well financial advisers who actually care about their clients and stay in the business will find that the same shift occurs in their industry which most americans probably thought was better regulated as usual until president came along there was a great injustice happening silently across the country but with tremendous work and perseverance something was done to make our country a better place and as sadly is usual republicans oppose it on the grounds of greed and lies republicans should be ashamed of themselves across the board for supporting a weak regulatory environment which impoverishes senior citizens just to protect a single special interest group this is yet another prime example of donald trumps failing presidential campaign combining the very worst republican ideas with the very worst ideas about race religion and human decency nobody should vote for any politician when their top priority is screwing over working people trying to save their money by helping bandits in white collars to screw over trusting victims
