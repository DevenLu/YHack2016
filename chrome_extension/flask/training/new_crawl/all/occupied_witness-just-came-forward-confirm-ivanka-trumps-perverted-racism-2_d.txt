the favorite child of the republican nominee trump was very taken aback at hearing her fathers lewd radio comments in which he admits to forcing himself on women and grabbing their genitals clutching her pearls and heady with the vapors a announced at fortunes most powerful women summit thats not language consistent with any conversation ever had with him certainly or any conversation overheard so it was a bit jarring for me to hear of course the issue is that your father is describing sexual assault not the fact that he said the word pussy nevertheless jonah has heard a very different side of and fired back at her from twitter she was saying how she first said she had never seen an uncircumcised cock and then she said never seen a mulatto cock theres lots of cocks never seen or something like that said to of course it was memorable just because of the use of the lewd language and racist language it was also memorable being in the environment of in new york sometimes liberal and progressive people make comments meant as jokes and not necessarily earnest know how to take it while theres nothing wrong with being interested in exploring relationships her choice of words is disturbing to say the least mulatto is an archaic and extremely offensive word with heavy connotations to the american slave trade describing a person of mixed black and white ancestry from a perspective of racial superiority in a time when one race sold the other like chattel you know like this the use of mulatto is so weirdly specific it reveals a racial of multiracial men seeing them as exotic sexual objects and not as people which funnily enough is exactly how her father treats women it just goes to show that donald trumps appalling racism and entitlement complex has been deeply ingrained in the whole family while we can giggle at the thought of what the donald will say when he finds out the daughter he himself sexually expressed interest in men of other races with presumably large hands the underlying racism is symbolic of a much larger issue the unhealthy view with which white americans view black americans the symptoms of which is trumps candidacy in the first place
