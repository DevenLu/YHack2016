donald trump won a legal election whiny liberal students white house staffers and celebrities comparing this to are pretty normal grist to the republican mill speaking as an ardent never who also supported the crying by some of my fellow reminds me of nothing so much as the endless whining from our nickname for remain supporters who wont accept the result perhaps donald trump is more mr than gave him credit for but heads of trump aside the united states has seen a normal transition thus far the democratic nominee concedes gracefully the republican winner makes an equally gracious victory speech the president receives the at the white house it may be indeed it was awkward and funny but that is about as far as anybody can go before the election the new york times printed an article on interference in the election citing fbi sources as saying that there was no trump camp collusion with russia they looked foolish today when russia started to boast that there had been plenty of it and later in the day the trump camp adamantly denied that was telling the truth but want to confess something as an ardent critic of the times reporting must admit that there was one argument in their piece attributed to fbi sources that does seem to be borne out by events if it is risible to suggest that russia was neutral in our election what nevertheless appears to be true is the statement that russia is not so much as chaos this line has been repeated by other reporters such as of newsweek in his investigations what could explain russia throwing donald trump and his campaign under the bus and admitting their ongoing links to as they claimed almost everybody within his entourage to those following the this makes no sense at first it was simultaneously put out by a trusted adviser that yes they had worked with something that throws not only donald trump but also under the bus and had claimed that they did not work with russia and now russia was calling a liar however apart from the obvious conclusion that working with russia is a fools errand if you expect loyalty or your secrets kept there is indeed one reason that russia would admit its contacts with the trump campaign with most of his entourage they say and admit on the same day that was lying and they gave the data dump to an admission which also makes donald trump look stupid in america as trump said no proof russia was doing it russia calculates that if it releases enough information about its contacts with his campaign and its spying work with perhaps the fbi will intensely investigate the he has no special constitutional protection until he takes the oath no sovereign immunity what if could pull some magic that would really plunge america into chaos as a never who credits her community sources this theory puts me in the odd position of having to row in behind donald trump after all whatever russia wants for america oppose as reported in newsweek what if this is true ultimate triumph would be to subvert an election then replace the unstable wild card by throwing him under the bus this would mean that with his rusty economy and nothing but a few twitter trolls had shown he could install and remove a us president at will trumps camp like the admission and said it was rubbish trump has good reason to deny it under penalty of perjury any trump nominee or even white house staffer would have to list their contacts with russia including names dates amounts of meetings and what was discussed in those meetings that could make things difficult for the and if russia is telling the truth make it much harder for trump to staff up as he wishes to it is certainly one viable theory that has decided to try to mess up the interregnum between presidents by pushing trump out after all if mr trump is convincingly shown that russia was trying to use him and is keeping compromising information on him his ego may well explode with rage could find that with power now in his hands donald trump is indeed less grateful and malleable than expected us intelligence will be able to tell trump whatever they know on that matter and what russia really thinks of him one rule of life on twitter is feed the trolls if you give trolls attention they magnify russian news outlets and twitter are currently trolling hard and in the traditional sense this time they are laughing at the us media for not investigating trumps links to russia til their admission of it today please investigate call for his they are boasting openly of russia helping with and how many times the kremlin met trump campaign personnel they boost stories of riots against trump and they try to get investigative journalists to write more about them have reluctantly been persuaded by this argument politics and even character aside the important thing for the patriotic conservative resistance to remember is that what russia wants for america america and her allies should resist and if russia wants mr trump thrown under a bus as much as it might go against the grain never trump should shrug its shoulders and support him the more panic the more anguish over influence in the white house the larger a bonus mr gets for his warfare trump knows the as his father once said and certainly know twitter know what trolls look like and how the russian operates and see what they are trying to do the way to annoy any troll on twitter is to ignore them hence the gnashing of teeth that have locked my twitter account so only my current followers can see it when accounts cannot my get to read what real people are talking about now in the same vein its time for all good patriots to strike back at by doing the hardest possible thing nothing whatsoever ignore him feed the trolls we have a good a strong paul in the house and in the senate mr trumps power is facing a red republican wall of its own legislators dedicated to the constitution the kremlin we hear had buyers remorse by ignoring their attempts to create chaos by not reacting to their petty goading we may well be enabling a beautifully serene american administration of constitutional conservatism where trump in policy terms can revert to the social democrat always been surrounded by perfectly decent conservative legislators and that would make mr wonder what let himself in for as the west and america grows in confidence and in power so we can let the pros in the fbi cia and gather their information and as to russia and we can laugh at them first and then put their entire army on mental mute its always been true folks let the drunks just cry into the wind as a trump administration does what it and not what pleases feed the trolls
