as the sexual assault allegations against republican nominee donald trump are met with appalling attempts to discredit his accusers many on the right have been demanding why the women report their assaults earlier there are hundreds of reasons why women report their assaults each one as disturbing as the last but it cant be denied that a major reason is that they know the justice system is stacked against them martin of glasgow montana plead guilty to raping a girl a relative on a charge of felony incest he was sentenced to years in prison all of it suspended he will have to register as a sex offender but otherwise will walk free after violating the innocence of a child under the deal he was charged for only one assault even though he admitted to several more assaults prosecutors were shocked after they agreed to a deal in which a guilty plea would have sentenced to years in state prison with of those years suspended the defense argued that suffered a collapse of social support after he lost his job and cited the fact that he was living at home with his parents and attending church every sunday as a defense which the judge accepted during his testimony indicated that he is currently living with his mother and is employed and attends church every sunday his testimony was confirmed when his mother took the stand and indicated my son is welcome at my home for any time that he needs only three in a hundred rapists in america will ever see jail for their crimes and apparently raping a old can be excused by a show of contrition and showing up to church no wonder the women of america are so reluctant to come forward with their assaults the disgusting show of victim blaming emanating from the trump campaign and the vicious response from his rabid followers against the victims is evidence enough of that
