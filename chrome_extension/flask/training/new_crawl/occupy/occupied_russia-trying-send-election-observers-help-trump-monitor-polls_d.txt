russian president dictator is trying to send election observers to america this november to provide direct assistance to republican nominee donald trumps quixotic quest to destroy democracy and win the race for president of the united states at the same time theres always a story within the story from russia and this story is all about trying to color outside the lines by demanding direct access to the polls instead of working through an accredited international monitoring agency which invited to staff the us state department immediately rejected the russian offer and state officials in texas even threatened to arrest any russian election observers latest aggressive propaganda ploy and direct assistance to trump is breaking a longstanding taboo in relations between the two nations to not directly or indirectly interfere in elections in reality the administration has invited european election observers as well as inviting the organization of american states to observe our polls primarily a means of encouraging participation in their hemispheric monitoring programs its obvious that the russian foreign ministry is playing games by asking to be an international election observe they might be trying to keep american election officials off balance so not sure where the kremlins agents may land which is another reason why russia too keen on joining the real election observer group formally invited by the us federal government during the russian presidential election that organization reported a irregularity rate in an election that won with a majority ironically russia today and that other official news sources conveniently forget that they themselves passed a law outlawing foreign agents according to human rights watch they wrote that administration and predecessors used their foreign agents law ban any foreign groups from observing and reporting on elections and very specifically to chase away the voting rights organization which monitored heavily disputed elections in and for the past four years the kremlin has sought to stigmatize criticism or alternative views of government policy as disloyal or even traitorous it is part of a sweeping crackdown to silence critical voices that has included new legal restrictions on the on freedom of expression on the rights of lesbian gay bisexual and people and on other fundamental freedoms an enduring central feature has been the law requiring independent groups to register as foreign agents if they receive any foreign funding and engage in broadly defined political activity in russia the term foreign agent can be interpreted by the public only as spy or traitor to date justice ministry has designated groups as foreign agents courts have levied staggering fines on many groups for failing to comply with the law and over groups have shut down rather than wear the foreign agent label russia just issued a harsh court decision just this month under that law to liquidate these are donald trumps friends the man that the republican nominee says he knows and presumably loves after you listen to his glowing review of the dictator the entire operation raises grave concerns that the republican nominees call to watch polls in certain places is being heard by the very same people who watched trump ask for lots of hacked and responded by delivering democrats private discussions to president called trumps relationship with a today reality is that the republican nominee is looking to president for an election day political bailout which is a lot more like what his daddy might do for little baby trump when he failed time after time in the private sector
