nobody in american politics cares more passionately about americas workers than senator sanders lately the republican nominee has been callously dragging name through the mud when discussing trade by falsely claiming that they share a single trade policy and pretending to care as much as the former democratic presidential candidate about the lives of the very people he screwed over when really been secretly buying big ticket items to build and fill his hotels from china all of these years sanders tweet in response to latest republican hypocrisy is perfect republicans want to disavow their racist candidate donald trump today only now that been as a sexual predator but the candidate himself keeps saying that americans should focus on election issues we agree because every issue trump brings up only further exposes his own personal hypocrisy and also his own pervasive scheme of lies that gave birth to the american demagogue our founding fathers always feared the truth is that donald trump has always bought cheap good overseas and been called out for it repeatedly as far back as on the late show with david letterman but no matter how often the truth is repeated his sheepish followers believe that since the republican talks a big game buying american to support them he is not not only that even thinks that the republican nominees shoddy ideas would send americas economy into the toilet
