fbi director james is being publicly criticized by former deputy attorney generals and others from the law enforcement community over breaking his neutrality to release a vague memo friday afternoon which amounted to official slander against democratic candidate reported first that university of minnesota law professor and former bush administration white house ethics counsel richard painter filed an official ethics complaint with the department of justices office of special counsel against the fbi director for abusing his office with pernicious political activity richard painters new filing against is similar to the complaint filed by the democratic coalition against trump lodged against the fbi director for violating the hatch act which restricts most federal employees from engaging in any partisan activity hours after originally filing this story professor painter wrote this in the new york times to explain why the fbi directors actions must not go unpunished on saturday filed a complaint against the with the office of special counsel which investigates hatch act violations and with the office of government ethics have spent much of my career working on government ethics and lawyers ethics including two and a half years as the chief white house ethics lawyer for president george bush and never thought that the could be dragged into a political circus surrounding one of its investigations until this week an official need to have a specific intent or desire to influence an election to be in violation of the hatch act or government ethics rules the rules are violated if it is obvious that the officials actions could influence the election there is no other good reason for taking those actions and the official is acting under pressure from persons who obviously do want to influence the election absent extraordinary circumstances that might justify it a public communication about a pending investigation involving a candidate for public office that is made on the eve of an election is thus very likely to be a violation of the hatch act and a misuse of an official position serious questions also arise under lawyers professional conduct rules that require prosecutors to avoid excessive publicity and unnecessary statements that could cause public condemnation even of people who have been accused of a crime not to mention people like who have never been charged with a crime this is no trivial matter we cannot allow or justice department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway that is an abuse of power allowing such a precedent to stand will invite more and even worse abuses of power in the future ironically the hatch act was passed because republicans thought that employees from one of new deal agencies were involved in partisan electioneering little did they know that today a registered republican fbi director was going to violate it blatantly right before an election painter and were colleagues in the bush administration when the latter held a position as deputy attorney general high ranking current department of justice officials discouraged from going public just days before a general election shamefully its been revealed that the fbi even have a warrant to view these newest yet former deputy attorney generals and larry who served administration with both parties issued a harshly worded in the washington post today entitled james is damaging our democracy they opined as former deputy attorneys general in the bill and george bush administrations we are troubled by the apparent departure from these standards in the investigation of server first the fbi director james put himself enthusiastically forward as the arbiter of not only whether to prosecute a criminal case which is not the job of the fbi but also best practices in the handling of and other matters now he has chosen personally to the balance between transparency and fairness departing from the departments traditions as former deputy attorney general george aptly put it theres a difference between being independent and flying solo at the same time attorney general lynch nominally boss has apparently been satisfied with advising but not ordering him to abide by the rules she no doubt did not want to override the fbi director in such a highly political matter but she should not have needed to he should have abided by the policy on his own the fbi director broke policy to inform congress about details of an investigation without any actual details or having even seen the new evidence that was so urgent that he had to break decades of policy in order to disclose it even stone age conservatives knew that these latest allegations are nothing more than a partisan political ploy describing the trump campaigns reaction in grim terms within hours of official memo breaking he released an internal cover your ass memo admitting that the letter could be misinterpreted which was instantly leaked to the washington post and proved that the fbi director understood fully the foolishness upon which he had embarked by interfering with an election newsweek pointed out that republican president george bush had undergone fbi investigation himself before being elected but nobody in the white house or the fbi used it to torpedo his presidential campaign amazingly a made requests in before the election and did get the fbi to release some files about bush in april of only five months after the election but he suspected that they provide everything and the records show that his requests to expedite release because of the election were denied the bush fbi files contained nothing about the events reported by the two former deputy attorney generals said it best now the top leadership is in open revolt over the directors political meddling as bipartisan condemnation is raining down upon the fbi director as his colleagues are openly telling the press that their boss compromised their agency to play partisan politics its probably only a matter of time before resigns and faces his own investigation for this entire sordid affair
