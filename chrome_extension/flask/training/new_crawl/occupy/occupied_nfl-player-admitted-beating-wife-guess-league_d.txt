its october which means its month for the national football league as they deck out their players with pink accessories and sell pink merchandise to fans in an effort to convince the nation that they care about the welfare of women but the case of new york giants kicker josh brown shows that all that is nothing but a hollow marketing gimmick since the league still refuses to treat domestic abuse with the severity it deserves brown was arrested on may by the king county sheriffs office following a domestic abuse incident the kicker admitted to abusing his wife physically verbally and emotionally in his personal journals that just came to light his now molly brown says he abused her on as many as twenty occasions following an internal investigation the league handed down a shocking one game suspension and allowed him to return to play the second week of this season now commissioner roger and the new york giants organization are scrambling to perform damage control after these shocking revelations sports news agency reports that brown beat his wife multiple times and new evidence came to light wednesday night and more continues to come out thursday the and the giants said they were unaware of the new findings but its been revealed this afternoon that the league actually helped browns switch hotel rooms at the pro bowl in january after a drunk brown was pounding on the room door brown is certain to be released in the near future amazing that it happened yet the giants have announced that brown will not be travelling to london for the teams sunday game against the angeles rams as they reopen their investigation in a league where players are handed down suspensions for marijuana use it is appalling to see them treat the issue of domestic abuse with such callous indifference after being rocked by public backlash for their terrible handling of the ray rice and hardy domestic violence cases it is clear the still learned their lesson the fact that the league was forced to move molly brown and her children to a different hotel room at the pro bowl to hide them from her drunk husband and then hand down a slap on the wrist is just outrageous love the sport of football with all my heart but this kind of behavior by shadowy league figures is absolutely unacceptable and both roger and the giants deserve to be raked over the coals for their attempts to shove domestic violence under the rug after all the ridiculous outcry over colin refusal to stand during the national anthem its clear that both fans and officials have astonishingly misguided priorities
