during the saga of republican presidential nominee donald trumps campaign it has become quite well known his supporters are viewed as those who harbor racial prejudices now a recent study has been published which has a shocking revelation that trumps supporters are indeed fueled by bigotry but this time proved by data and not just the opinions of those on the the washington post conducted their experiment on trump supporters by on a survey conducted by the university of center for the study of political psychology in essence they took two pictures of innocuous looking males one white and one black standing in front of a foreclosure sign the pictures were identical except for the race of the individual after looking at the image of trumps supporters were asked to answer questions about their impressions of granting mortgage assistance all of the trump supporters were white this due to a racial prejudice on the behalf it was due to there being nearly zero supporters of trump there were a handful of but the amount was so few they could not be used in the study the photographs were not mentioned during the questioning nor was attention drawn to them at any point the photographs were merely used to prime the trump supporters biases when individuals who did not support trump were asked if they supported mortgage assistance who saw the image of the white man by the sign opposed mortgage assistance compared to only who saw the image of a black man standing by the same sign trumps supporters showed completely opposite results with being against mortgage assistance when seeing the white individual and being against mortgage assistance who saw a black person standing by the sign not convinced theres more when asked if they were somewhat angry about mortgage assistance the exact same scenario played out of supporters claimed to be somewhat angry when shown the image of the white man by the sign as opposed to only when shown the same mortgage sign with a black man in the image conversely of trump supporters who were shown the image of a white man described themselves as somewhat angry while of trump supporters who saw the image of a black man were somewhat angry the real kicker came when respondents were asked if the individuals who might qualify for mortgage assistance were more than somewhat to blame for their financial predicament keep in mind none of the individuals included in the study were given any information at all about the hypothetical financial status of any person seeking mortgage assistance they allowed their own biases to determine that for them and for three out of three times trumps supporters were automatically more against the black man in the sign the evidence shows of supporters who saw the image of a white man say those seeking assistance were more than somewhat to blame but only said the same when they saw the image of a black man trump supporters staying true to their stereotype were again the complete opposite when asked if individuals seeking mortgage assistance from the government were more than somewhat to blame for their financial situation who saw the white image agreed as opposed to against the trump supporters who saw the image of a black man none of these findings were a mere fluke or twisted in any way according to the authors as trumps campaign has been built upon hatred fear and division this evidence may not be news to some but it does present reproducible evidence of the persistent biases in trumps supporters try as they might trumps base will shrug their shoulders and claim the media has skewed the facts to present them in a light the evidence proves that it is not the media but trumps base who have made themselves appear this way all on their own related items style trump supporters
