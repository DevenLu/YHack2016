one of the most memorable lines from last nights final presidential debate was donald trumps characterization of as such a nasty woman continuing an endless string of abuse he has heaped upon her throughout the campaign like so many of his campaign positions however trumps supposed hatred for is nothing but an act and recently unearthed footage from proves it in the interview with ny trump absolutely gushes with praise for calling her a wonderful woman a very smart woman and a very nice person when asked about her legacy trump said that she is going to go down at a minimum as a great senator think she was a great wife to a great president and think bill was a great president trump then goes on to praise bill presidency saying that the economy was doing great look at what happened during the years mean we had no war the economy was doing great everybody was happy such tremendous praise be further from the tone trump has taken on the campaign trail where has become someone with tremendous hate in her heart who should be in jail and bill has into the worst abuser of women in political history and through his signing of the supposed source of all evil in the country today the constantly insulting and sensationalist tone of the trump campaign is already a stain on our democracy but it seems even more deplorable when it becomes clear that all that anger is a sham and it is not just on the but on virtually every signature policy he so viciously defends that trump has made a complete over the past few years in reality he is nothing but a narcissistic old bully who wanted to add the presidency to the goodie bag of accomplishments he feels his privilege entitles him to and realized that the best way to do so would be to mimic the republican industry of outrage that has so deluded voters over the past several years tragically millions of americans fell for his trap but we can still stop him in his tracks by voting in november watch trumps comments from below
