democratic nominee just finished this week in position to record a landslide victory based on polling after her republican opponents collapse picked up steam even conservative bastions like texas utah and the birthplace of indicate waning support for donald trumps miserable campaign of lies and bigotry solidly red states like arizona and georgia which voted blue in a generation are considered toss ups right now texas voters are saying they only prefer trump but thats inside the polls point margin for error the republican admitted to having a tremendous problem in utah where polls show a dead heat between trump and voters even alaska polling shows the democratic nominee trailing by only points in a two way race also inside the margin for error the post writes the last time a democrat won alaska was when johnson carried it over texas voted for a democrat for president since jimmy carter eked out the state in in utah like alaska is the last democrat to win the possibility now exists for a historic election realignment along the lines of what we saw in when claimed victories in places like north carolina virginia and indiana states where no democrat since carter or johnson had won simply put trump is not just in danger of losing he is in danger of causing a fundamental reorganization of the electoral map that could set back republicans for a number of future elections this week the trump campaign literally gave up on virginia entirely after firing their state campaign chair for attending a protest rally at republican national committee headquarters in washington dc without permission while the candidate toured florida to say that the was against him and that party leadership sucked forget safe zones someone build this campaign an zone however the trump campaign could still win without electoral votes but no modern republican candidate has a legitimate shot at electoral victory without florida whats happening in florida today is nothing short of an organizational landslide the democratic party has racked up new voter registrations compared with a paltry registrations by the republicans trumps team has no chance at making up the difference in florida because the clock is ticking and the nominee key elements of his campaign like the entire ground game to the who doing much if anything these days in independent expenditures let alone national spokesman spicer swore in a public statement two months ago that the camp knows that the trump campaign and the combined efforts are outpacing their field republican operatives describe the statement thusly even the latino civic engagement group trump wrongly claims that federal judge belongs to the national council of la has registered voters in florida nearly all of whom are latino for those keeping track at home thats more than the republican national party has registered the trump campaign is focused on four states right now florida pennsylvania north carolina and ohio he will be lucky to win a single one of those states on election day democratic nominee cant rest on her laurels just yet though because as seen in this election just about anything that can happen will happen but she had better make sure that her transition team is ramping up because its looking like going to be awful busy on november when the campaign team stands down as of today the biggest questions remaining are will democratic voters prove house speaker correct and take back the senate handing vermont senator sanders a key role in congress or will voters take away speaker gavel and give democrats the house back as well even though the lower houses electoral map been deeply gerrymandered
