trump has bragged about incorporating tax evasion as a fundamental aspect of his business strategy according to a report from usa today the man running to be president of the united states has admitted to doing anything and everything he can to not pay his fair share including waiting for ny state to file warrants against him trumps tactic is to dispute the value of his properties undercutting them by up to of what they are actually worth residents are outraged over this and the entire his legion of blind be too for years trump has avoided the most basic requirement the government demands of its citizens to pay taxes when asked about his tax returns or his tax rate he responds with a defiant none of your business however it is very much our business the nation deserves to know how much trump has cheated us out of such as funding for things like education or infrastructure by not paying tax trumps companies have been engrossed in tax disputes every single year since the in fact since trump declared his candidacy in june at least five of his companies were issued warrants for back takes totalling more than feels like a very conservative this in itself goes to show the degree of neglect paid to tax as getting a warrant from the state is not exactly the first step in collection you have to ignore us to end up with a tax warrant says spokesman for the state department of taxation and finance we try to work with taxpayers to resolve the debt long before it becomes a warrant if these warrants go ignored further the tax claim is resolved in court this is often a cheaper solution to paying taxes and obviously trump factors this in trying to pay as little as possible he has been very about ignoring taxes and claiming devalued properties as a strategy fight like hell to pay as little as possible he said at a new york news conference in september fight like hell always because its an expense and you know feel and fight have the best lawyers and the best accountants and fight and pay but its an expense in ny for instance trump has claimed a golf course is worth million as opposed to its real value of million with this declaration trump cheated the community out of the they should have collected for local schools instead only paying local residents that trump has blatantly robbed from are up in arms over his tactic of declaring property is worth a fraction of what it should be to avoid paying his fair share of taxes what claiming is way off says manor homeowner steve cohen see people playing there the club looks fabulous it certainly falling into disrepair trumps attorney is not shrinking away from this fact owning up to the fact that the property is worth well over what the camp has claimed maybe its worth million maybe million told the journal news now my value is my opinion until its proven otherwise the property in is among other properties which trump has valued at more than million which accounts for billion of his billion net worth someone with this level of money should be completely banned from bringing property value into dispute he should be forced to pay not only what he owes but more than that he should not hide from this responsibility with lawyers and complaints but be glad to pay it the greed trump has demonstrated is disgusting and is no way america can choose this man to represent us with a clear conscious among other tax disputes involving trump entities trump mortgage owes federal taxes from and totaling more than according to two federal tax liens filed in new york trumps businesses have sued the new york city tax commission times from the through disputing the property assessment values on everything from apartment complexes once owned by his father to his core buildings and companies companies have become embroiled in disputes over sales taxes owed to new york state and new york city tax warrants on file in new york county court found that over the past years trump entities owed about in back taxes which were eventually paid the battles can save trump millions of dollars in trump won a ruling on his headquarters at trump tower in midtown manhattan it was the sixth time since that his appeals against the tax commission reached the courtroom records show the net result was about a reduction over years on the building worth about million to trump this also goes to show trumps mentality in spite of having the money to buy and renovate incredible properties he will do anything he can to hoard these profits it is a grotesque display of greed one that we cannot let go unchecked the systems that trump takes advantage of have been built in for the there is no alternative to paying taxes if you make under a million dollars annually trump has hustled the system at the expense of every citizen as president he will not change this behavior his plans are completely unclear the only thing thats certain is he will use his new role to get away with even more corrupt dealings as ambiguously stated as early as last week he is willing to pay more taxes personally he did not explicitly mention his businesses and that taxes for the rich will go up somewhat under his cant get more vague than that its far past time that trump and the rest of his oligarch buddies paid their fair share related items style trump
