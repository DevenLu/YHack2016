after the revelation of republican presidential nominee donald trumps nefarious comments made in where he happily recounted his exploits of sexually assaulting women the floodgates have opened and women from trumps past are speaking out one in particular miss washington recounts how trump attempted to force himself on her only three years ago so much for the trump campaigns excuse that what he said was locker room talk and is not an accurate representation of who he is as a man because all evidence proves otherwise cassandra the former miss washington shared a withering story on of her past interactions with trump in which he degraded her and numerous other contestants of the miss usa pageant which trump owned from to she wrote do remember that one time we had to do our onstage introductions but this one guy treated us like cattle and made us do it again because we look him in the eyes do you also remember when he then proceeded to have us lined up so he could get a closer look at his property oh forgot to mention that guy will be in the running to become the next president of the united states love the idea of having a misogynist as the president then went on to drop another bombshell she said in a comment on her post that trump groped her repeatedly and attempted to lure her up to his hotel room while did not state what trumps intentions were if she had accepted his offer one is safe in assuming it have been to look at pictures of his grandchildren the behavior by trump attempting to lure women back to his hotel room is well documented twenty years prior to the incident involving a former female business partner of trump jill recounted in that trump said to her lets go in my room want to lie down knowing full well she had a boyfriend george as trump said to him very attracted to your girlfriend trump was married at the time and would later settle a sexual harassment lawsuit brought by for neither of these incidents were mere blips on the radar but crystallized examples of trumps long pathology of attempting to force himself on women thus far dozens of women have come forward to share their stories of trumps attempts to use his power to coerce them into sexually compromising positions and considering the frequency with which the revelations are coming there is no reason to believe the avalanche of trumps debauchery will end anytime soon
