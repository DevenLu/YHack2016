today is veterans day the hallowed celebration of our brave fighting men and women who risk their lives and limbs to defend the american people and to protect our nations interests abroad which makes it even more painful to come to terms with the fact that we have just elected a man who has actively and cheated our veterans time and time again exploiting them as useful political props and discarding them again when served their purpose lets take a look at how our really feels about our fighting men and women donald trump insulted john for getting captured saying not a war hero a war hero because he was captured like people who captured now john may have a deplorable record as a senator but his heroism and his service to his country cannot be denied john bomber was shot down by a missile on october his right leg and both arms were broken by the force of the ejection and his subsequent crash where he was taken prisoner by the north vietnamese he was later tortured and held in captivity for five years he was offered an early release since he was the son of an admiral and he refused to take it for which he was tortured again sacrificed more for this country than donald trump ever could and he still has the nerve to insult him for it donald trump once tweeted out that women in the military were responsible for their own sexual assaults what did these geniuses expect when they put men women together said the of the united states given his own lengthy record of sexual assault it is that trump would think that all men are entitled to behave as he does just grab them by the pussy as trump said on a hot in of all genders in the military were sexually assaulted were men and countless others have gone unreported trumps statements echoes the reprehensible way gaslit and demonized his own sexual assault accusers and is appalling to hear from our donald trump said that only weak veterans get saying when people come back from war and combat and they see things that maybe a lot of the folks in the room have seen many times over and strong and you can handle it but a lot of people cant handle it as low as and as high as of our veterans suffer from stress disorder which is an extremely serious mental affliction that can affect anyone exposed to trauma donald trump having never faced a situation he buy his way out of has no conception of what sacrifice or trauma truly is a child of a golden spoon had everything in his life handed to him trumps disdain for the struggles of our veterans is disgusting donald trump has been sued by several veterans for violating federal law and refusing to give them back their previous jobs with in the trump university scam one trump administrator told senior master richard wright of the expeditionary group that you have been here less than three months your time off for the air force find it insulting that you would make a request to be paid for time you did not work personal time you did not earn wright earned three different medals for outstanding service during his personal time in afghanistan these war heroes came back from dodging and fighting terrorism in the middle east only to be rudely dismissed trump was forced to quickly pay out settlements to the vets but it just goes to show how little he respects them and their service donald trump who dodged the vietnam draft with imaginary medical conditions said that having unprotected sex with models was his own personal vietnam young americans died while trump was busy getting his rocks off in one of his most horrendous moments donald trump and his surrogates attacked and besmirched the service and the family of khan who died heroically saving his unit from an insurgent car bomb in iraq after his grieving father khan told the that trump know the meaning of sacrifice trump said think made a lot of sacrifices work very very created thousands and thousands of jobs think those are sacrifices think when can employ thousands and thousands of people take care of their education take care of so many things trump has thousands of people and run his businesses so poorly that tens of thousands have lost their livelihoods so that he could make himself rich he then went on to slander khans wife who did not speak at the convention but told reporters she was overwhelmed with grief she had nothing to say she probably maybe she allowed to have anything to say you tell me trump is obviously implying that she allowed to speak because her husband let her playing on the ignorance of americans and painting islam in a misogynist light infuriating from a man who once said that a woman looked better on her knees so if you voted for donald trump want to hear one goddamn word of empty reverence for our veterans this is the man you chose to be our your vote was a tacit endorsement of all these things said and done and our fighting men and women deserve better than this related items style trump veterans
