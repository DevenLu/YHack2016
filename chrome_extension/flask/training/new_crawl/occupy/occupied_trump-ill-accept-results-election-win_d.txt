today donald trump backtracked if you can call it that on his refusal to accept the election results and concede no matter the results today at a rally in ohio he declared that he will be happy to accept the election results but only if he wins if he loses he says he would be asked to waive centuries of legal precedent designed to protect the voters and that he will reserve my right to contest or file a legal challenge in the case of a questionable result all of which is nonsense of course and is just trumps nascent authoritarian streak spinning hollow justifications for repudiating our nations proud tradition of peaceful power transition been raked over the coals by politicians pundits and angry citizens for his dangerous talk but still gleefully refuses to respect centuries of democratic tradition in his egotistical quest for our nations highest office refusing to accept the results of the election is a tactic common among dictators and other authoritarian strongmen and the results of those power vacuum are often extremely violent and deadly opposition leader who lost a rigged election to dictator robert spoke out today and made it clear just how dangerous trumps words really are not just to our nation but to the health of democracy across the globe donald trump is a gift to all dictators on the african continent he is giving currency and legitimacy to rigging because if it can exist in america it can exist anywhere he has no idea what talking about absolutely no idea it makes us cross because in africa theres real election rigging was arrested in on treason charges after speaking out against election rigging and was brutally tortured in prison somehow despite our best efforts to prove otherwise america is still a beacon of freedom and hope to oppressed peoples across the world a symbol of democratic success and peace trumps comments are not only an insult to the values our nation was founded on but a blow to the hope of millions who pray that someday they will be able to have elections that end in riots ethnic cleansing and civil wars just because one side refuses to concede watch his astonishing remarks here
