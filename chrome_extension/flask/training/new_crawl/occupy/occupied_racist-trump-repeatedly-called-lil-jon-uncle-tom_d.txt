the allegations of making racially derogatory comments continue to pile up against republican presidential nominee donald trump with new evidence coming to light that during the filming of the apprentice trump repeatedly used a bizarre term to describe a famous recording artist who was also a contestant three former staffers from the apprentice have all told the same story that during the taping of the season which was called celebrity apprentice trump made repeated racially insensitive remarks to the artist behind the wildly popular song turn down for what apparently to complete a task given by trump thought it would be appropriate to dress up like uncle sam to help promote hair care products trump learned of the artists gimmick and immediately began to refer to as uncle tom rather than uncle sam one staffer described trumps comments with trump shouting look uncle tom trump found the name to be music to his idiotic racist ears and kept repeating it over and over word quickly spread across the studio to other contestants including hall is also who expressed his outrage that trump would use such a term the shows producers who began doing damage control and accosted trump about his choice of words a staffer speaking on a condition of anonymity due to nondisclosure agreement vividly recalled the scene one of the executive producers had to call him up directly to plead with him not to say it and trump was like no thats a saying its uncle tom there are several takes in the footage of the dailies that has him trying to figure out the difference between uncle tom and uncle sam he just grasp that it was when trump decides he wants to do something thats his way clearly trump a paragon of white privilege would know what terms are racist or insensitive as he is an individual who is up on all terms considering he has been trapped in a akin to the his entire life another former staff member said it was not like he was saying the or anything but understand why he just realize he was being offensive with that particular term why because trumps a bumbling buffoon thats why the trump campaign was asked to respond to the allegations they quickly responded trumps campaign spokeswoman hope hicks said this is simply untrue has the trump campaign ever admitted to wrong doing no besides the story was corroborated by himself via twitter he wrote when this uncle tom incident happened on celebrity apprentice in the several of my and addressed mr trump immediately when we heard the comment the rapper wrote on twitter cant say if he knew what he was actually saying or not but he did stop using that term once we explained offensiveness also want to be clear that agree with many of the statements mr trump has said during his current run for president further evidence exists from four years ago in that this incident occurred an individual who claimed to work for the apprentice wrote to the gossip the dirty with the following account that partly read trumps past comments of making racially insensitive comments are well documented he once for example said got black accountants at trump castle and at trump plaza black guys counting my money hate it the only kind of people want counting my money are short guys that wear yarmulkes every day those are the kind of people want counting my money nobody else besides that got to tell you something else think that the guy is lazy and its probably not his fault because laziness is a trait in blacks it really is believe that its not anything they can control while the footage of trumps uncle tom comments has yet to be unearthed one can decide for themselves if they believe trump who has been making insensitive comments about every possible group of people possible for years would have called an uncle tom the public is also awaiting footage from the apprentice where it has been alleged trump used the actual on camera numerous times
