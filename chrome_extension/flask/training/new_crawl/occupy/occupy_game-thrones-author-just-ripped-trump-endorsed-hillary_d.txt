author george martins books inspired the hit tv series game of thrones and no stranger to political intrigues even the legendary fantasy writer martin never imagined an american demagogue who could blithely step on every third rail of american politics and survive in the race until the general election but the man who wrote televisions most hated character just took to his to explain definitively why donald trump will never be fit to sit on the iron throne be president in my lifetime there has never been a presidential candidate more unfit to lead this nation martins book a song of fire and ice inspired the hit tv series which is loosely based on the war of the roses as the warring clans of fight for control of the iron throne for much of the series the throne has been captured by golden haired whose endless list of offensive behaviors begins as a callous child and continues through his disastrous reign like the fictional donald trump loves to sit on fancy chairs and using his wealth and influence to play at being king the author martin described the highly unusual nature of this years presidential election by zeroing in on the striking difference between negative advertisements for the two candidates he shrewdly pointed out that donald trumps attack ads are standard political ad hominem affairs lots of selective editing and bluster no substance while democratic nominee even create traditional attack ads martins list of the many attack ads doubles as a fine reason that nobody in their right mind should choose the republican nominee for president this upcoming tuesday november does not need to use the sort of hoary attack ads that trump is using she only needs to present him as he is and let his own words condemn them and they do no one has to accuse trump of anything he has laid it all out there in public for the world to see yes he mocked a disabled reporter there he is doing it yes he told billy bush he liked to kiss women without their consent and grab them by their pussies there he is boasting about it when a star you can do anything no need to accuse trump of going into the dressing rooms of miss universe and miss teen usa when the contestants were changing so he could see them naked theres trump himself telling stern about it yes he said women should be punished for having abortions there he is telling his own words his own face yes he said he wants to ban all muslims from entering the us here see the clip yes in favor of japan and saudi arabia and south korea having nukes heres the clip where he says so and on and on and on and on the gold star family the bad hombres judge the miss universe his own speeches his own tweets his own words martin even remarked that for a man whose campaign resembles a nastier version of george it is eerily starting to look like his claim was correct when in january trump said he could shoot a man on fifth avenue in new york and get away with it if theres any one moment in the republicans campaign that could be described as that was the one where like the fictional twisted boy king donald trump reveled openly in a threat to kill senselessly and kill with impunity the dastardly character uncle described the in a way that anyone watching the trust fund baby donald trump might use to describe the oddly coiffed republican candidate had vicious kings and had idiot kings but think ever been cursed with a vicious idiot for a king the same harsh words equally apply to republican nominee donald trumps disastrous fall as the standard bearer of his failed party the we agree with george martin all any voter needs to do is listen rationally to the irrational trump speak and realize that not presidential material and has a personality only fit to be an erratic and certainly never to sit in the chair behind the resolute desk in the oval office watch a hilarious here
