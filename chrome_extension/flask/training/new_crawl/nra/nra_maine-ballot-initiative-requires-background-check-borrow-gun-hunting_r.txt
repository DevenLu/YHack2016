the maine ballot initiative labeled question requires individuals to go through background checks before borrowing a gun from a friend for the purposes of hunting while this will not keep anyone safer it will have the result of increasing the paper trail on guns and gun owners thereby providing the government with yet another avenue by which they can search out guns that were purchased privately off the books rather than at retail news has long warned that the expansion of background checks is a tool that governments whether state or federal can use to find guns for which no paper trail currently exists and question is a perfect illustration of the validity of such warnings according to the portland press herald the debate over question is increasingly focused on language that would require background checks before could loan guns to each other an issue that has allowed opponents to rally hunters and other gun owners against the ballot measure moreover the background check that would be required for loaning a gun to a friend carries a fee in other words you not only help create a paper trail for the shotgun your grandfather gave you before he passed away but also pay for the services that create such a trail once these aspects of the initiative were uncovered support for question dropped from percent in early october to barely over percent by october and there is no reason to doubt that support has continued to wane at the same time polls show that determined opposition to question has made a sharp increase is the second amendment columnist for news and host of bullets with a news he is also the political analyst for armed american radio follow him on twitter reach him directly at
