supposed to defeat michael agenda on the ballot yesterday his propaganda was too powerful his budget was limitless and his paid grassroots army was unstoppable the media seemed to be with him at every turn echoing his talking points as fact and endorsing the question one after another and all along the polls were in his favor but mr made one fatal mistake he underestimated the power of the little guy he thought that victory in maine through our ballot referendum process would be simple and that we would be a bargain only by saturating our media with his lies and propaganda he thought he could convince that theres something wrong with our community but he failed to take into account our longstanding tradition of responsible gun ownership and safety much like the humane society of the united states did twice before him he wanted you to believe that maine gun owners are irresponsibly exploiting some loophole instilling fear into the hearts of those who understand our culture and traditions he wanted to dictate exactly how when where and with whom you exercise your right to own and possess a firearm while his paid minions wanted you to believe he was targeting criminals his opponents knew he was actually targeting citizens through intentionally confusing unenforceable language with the hopes that in maine gun owners would be too fearful to exercise our rights out in the open as a community most of all he wanted a universal gun registry so that he could map out all firearms in maine he think that we would be smart enough that it would be possible for the opposition to band together or compile enough resources to fend him off he thought maine would be a cheap date but he was wrong on a shoestring budget the maine firearm community across the state banded together creating a true grassroots army of law enforcement community leaders and activists to educate friends relatives and neighbors about the dangers question this election proved once again that in maine the firearm community will not sit down and remain silent while money pours in from special interests from away to strip us of our rights no matter the odds wont be intimidated and we certainly wont be silenced yesterday banded together to achieve the unthinkable yesterday in maine david beat by telling michael that we will not be a part of his million agenda mr learned the hard way that will always stand and fight for what we know to be right said no against all odds and never been prouder to call this great state home
