when it comes to big choices facing voters on election day its not all about versus donald trump down the ballot are a variety of initiatives from the raising of the minimum wage to the restriction of gun purchases to the reinstatement of the death penalty heres a look at some of the issues americans will decide on an increase in the minimum wage is on the ballot in four states something more than a dozen other states have done since voters in arizona colorado maine and washington will decide whether to elevate their states wage floors to amounts ranging from to an hour by a fifth state south dakota will consider excluding teenagers from a recently passed increase supporters say higher minimum wages would put more money into consumers pockets and help pull people off public assistance opponents say businesses that are already scraping by would be hit too hard pointing to restaurants as particularly vulnerable gov paul of maine delivered perhaps the strongest defense of business owners who could suffer from higher minimum wages to me when you go out and kill somebody you go to jail he told a regional radio station well this is attempted murder in my mind because it is pushing people to the brink of survival in all of the states considering increases minimum wages already exceed the federal floor of among them washington is considered a trailblazer with seattle being the first major american city to pay its workers an hour the proposal on the ballot would raise the state minimum to by from some states are experiencing a crosscurrent with employers saying the changes are going too far and too fast for them to keep up in colorado and washington opponents say that the proposed statewide shifts are feasible in cities with vibrant economies like denver and seattle but that rural areas would suffer south dakotas measure to decrease wages for teenage workers would pare down an increase that passed in should corporate taxes go up oregon voters will consider a measure to raise corporate taxes as a way help the state generate more revenue if approved the measure is expected to help general fund grow by almost a third or about billion a year through a percent tax on corporate gross sales that exceed million he initiative language says the money would augment state spending on education health care and senior services but does not bind the legislature to a specific plan labor unions and teachers are leading the fight for passage arguing that decades of erosion in education funding are the cause of the states dismal high school graduation rate opponents fueled by contributions from large corporations argue that companies will simply raise prices and pass the cost along to consumers or might cut jobs or move operations elsewhere what to do with the death penalty four death penalty initiatives are on the ballot including two conflicting proposals in california one california measure would do away with the death penalty the other would speed up the process of executing those on death row california has people awaiting execution more than any other state while juries have been willing to sentence people to death actual executions have been rare only since california reinstated the death penalty in if proposition is passed the strongest punishment available under california law would be life without the possibility of parole those on death row would see their sentences commuted to life without parole attempts to pass a similar measure in failed proposition takes a different approach by trying to eliminate the obstacles to carrying out the death penalty and shorten the time between conviction and execution the provisions of the initiative include a limit on the appeals process if both measures pass the one receiving the most votes would prevail nebraska voters will decide whether to repeal a bill passed by the legislature in that ended the death penalty by commuting death sentences to life in prison in oklahoma voters will consider a constitutional amendment that would protect the death penalty the state the first to develop the lethal injection protocol faced a legal challenge on the constitutionality of its methods after a botched execution the referendum if passed would amend the state constitution to prevent the death penalty from being declared cruel or unusual punishment should gun buying be restricted voters in california which already has some of the toughest gun laws will consider an initiative that would require people buying ammunition to pass a background check and to obtain authorization from the department of justice ammunition would have to be bought from licensed dealers the initiative would also ban magazines for firearms extending previously passed restrictions on their ownership maine and nevada have proposals to more tightly regulate gun purchases a measure in maine would extend the requirement for background checks to include most private sales of guns a similar proposal in nevada would require most private buyers and sellers to conduct a background check through a licensed gun dealer a proposal in washington would allow courts to issue extreme risk protection orders to prevent people named in the orders from owning or getting firearms if there is a risk of harm to them or others should carbon emissions be taxed a measure under consideration in washington would make it the first state to impose a tax on carbon emissions modeled after a similar initiative in british columbia just to the north the measure would tax the sale or use of certain fossil fuels and electricity generated from fossil fuels the revenue generated would be offset by a reduction in some other taxes supporters argue that residents have a moral responsibility to address climate change opponents say the measure would strain household budgets by increasing gasoline and electricity costs should maine increase taxes on high earners an initiative in maine is simple but unusual should the state tax those earning more than a year an additional percent and use the money for public education the state estimates that it would provide million in school funding which supporters say is badly needed while opponents argue that it would drive out businesses and high earners imperiling the states tepid economic growth the tax foundation a nonpartisan though group that researches tax policy said the measure would give maine the top individual tax rate in the country after california should massachusetts have more charter schools it has become a subject of fierce debate in one of the top states for public education should massachusetts lift its cap on charter schools the state has charter schools and counts more than students on waiting lists many of them in urban districts like boston a ballot proposal would allow new charter schools to open each year polling suggests that public opinion might have turned against the move after a sustained opposition supported by teachers unions the and public school committees opponents got a boost in september when senator elizabeth warren a democrat said she would vote against the question gov charlie baker a republican supports the measure should colorado adopt a health plan a proposed amendment in colorado would radically transform the states health insurance system creating a plan that would cover all residents state insurance would replace private insurance and consumers would no longer have premiums or deductibles though they would make the endeavor would be paid for by a percent payroll tax employers would contribute and individuals an elected board would control many aspects of the program the amendment has divided traditional allies in the liberal community supporters say it would fix an expensive system still laden with coverage gaps save billion by reducing bureaucracy and ease economic pain in mountain towns where people with few providers face premiums opponents say the details are too vague and the cost of the program too big its budget would be about billion dwarfing that of the state government and an independent examination by the colorado health institute found that the state could come up billion short in annual revenue by the programs year should constitutional change be restricted a colorado measure would make it more difficult to put constitutional amendments on the state ballot the measure could have major consequences for people and communities opposing many of whom see the ballot as the last avenue for reining in oil and gas companies opponent say the measure amendment would benefit industries while pushing out the ideas of activists on a wide range of issues including oil and gas supporters however say the amendment would stop constitution from becoming a jumbled mess and ensure that residents have a voice in major decisions prominent backers include gov john and four former governors should assisted suicide be allowed proposition would make colorado the sixth state to allow terminally ill people to take their own lives using medication prescribed by a doctor the initiative would require two doctors to confirm a person is terminally ill and mentally capable the patient must be at least years old the measure is modeled after death with dignity act last year people took their lives using the statute a number that has trended upward since the measure was enacted in should kansas judges retain their seats the tug of war between the judiciary and the legislative branch of government will play out in kansas on election night when the fate of five state supreme court judges will be determined in retention elections the typically pro forma elections in which voters decide whether justices may keep their seats have taken on a particularly bitter and partisan tenor this year this comes after years of court rulings that have rebuffed policies set by the conservative state legislature and as lawmakers have maneuvered to reshape the judiciary the kansas supreme court comprising mostly justices appointed by democratic and republican governors who preceded the current republican governor sam has ruled that the legislature has not adequately and equitably funded public schools it has struck down abortion restrictions and overturned death penalty sentences the states conservative lawmakers who dominate the legislature have accused the court of impeding on their territory in response they passed a bill taking away the power of the supreme court to appoint chief judges in the district courts and threatened to strip the judiciary of all funding if it found that law unconstitutional they have floated legislation to allow for the impeachment of justices and to give the governor more power in appointing them justices face retention votes every six years and five of the seven on the supreme court are up this year only one of those up for retention was appointed by mr the key forces against retention include the states republican party and the house republican caucus which has sent out opposing retention of the four justices appointed by mr predecessors a coalition that includes four former governors two democrats and two republicans is lobbying in favor of retaining the justices saying that the judiciary should not be subject to political winds
