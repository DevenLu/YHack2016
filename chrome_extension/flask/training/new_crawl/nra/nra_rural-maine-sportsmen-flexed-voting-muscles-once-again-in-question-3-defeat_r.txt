the campaign to require background checks on private gun sales won broad support in southern coastal maine but faltered throughout rural and interior areas despite opponents more than to in many ways the outcome of the question campaign mirrored the results and the political dynamics of the failed ballot initiative over bear baiting and trapping opponents were able to tap into sizable sporting community and skepticism toward interest groups to defeat an issue that supporters insisted was aimed at criminals not hunters and is already in effect in more than a dozen states maine has a long history of gun ownership gun usage and a strong hunting tradition and that matters said mark brewer political science professor at the university of maine at any time that seems to be under attack it is easy to mobilize that sentiment question sought to close a loophole in maine law that could allow criminals domestic abusers or individuals with mental illness to purchase guns from private sellers without a background check but opponents seized on the fact that question would also require background checks before could loan or trade guns to each another practices that are relatively common among hunters and sport shooters with percent of precincts reporting the yes on campaign was trailing percent to percent according to unofficial results the campaign conceded late wednesday morning after organizers determined they would be unable to close a roughly gap question played well in the majority of larger towns and cities especially those along the southern coast and in the more than percent of portland voters for instance voted for question support also topped percent in south portland cape elizabeth and camden and exceeded percent in towns such as and brunswick statewide results for question precincts reporting of even slightly off the coast however support for the ballot initiative fell sharply the measure failed in communities throughout western central northern and down east maine with the exception of isolated pockets such as the area and on mount desert island and just as support topped percent in some southern coastal towns opposition neared or exceeded percent in grand lake stream and other interior towns where hunting is a major part of the local culture and economy the alliance of maine and its allies hit the transfer issue hard with hunters with apparent success executive director david believes the decision by the question campaign to go beyond private sales took a toll had this been written differently think the outcome might have been different said a veteran of ballot initiative scene was a key player in the campaign to rally sportsmen and rural against the bear hunting baiting and hounding referendum in spearheaded by the humane society of the united states that initiative failed percent to percent just percentage point different from the unofficial outcome of tuesdays vote on question think what that says is sportsmen and gun owners are a huge voting block we can swing elections and we can swing referendum campaigns said a former state senator from question supporters see things somewhat differently and defended the inclusion of language requiring background checks on gun transfers david farmer campaign manager for for responsible gun ownership said he believes that question simply got caught in the unprecedented dynamics that led to donald trumps election as president while attempting to take on the powerful gun lobby the transfers were used to confuse voters farmer said if it been transfers they would have found another issue think what impacted it more was the dynamics of the race and the gun lobby has sworn to oppose any changes to gun laws whether at the congressional level or in the states both sides received hefty financial support from national groups involved in the gun debate much of question roughly million campaign was bankrolled by for gun safety the organization started by vocal advocate and former new york city mayor michael opponents seized on involvement accusing his organization of attempting to import gun control laws to a state with one of the lowest gun violence rates in the nation supporters countered that guns sold on unregulated private market help fuel gun violence in states like new york and massachusetts which have tougher gun laws opponents meanwhile received more than million from the powerful national rifle association the head of the institute for legislative action praised maine voters on wednesday for rejecting the gun control agenda of former new york city mayor michael and securing the rights of every brewer said opponents were successful in playing up financial ties to the campaign even as they ignored the support for their side brewer also agreed that inclusion of the transfers language provided ammunition to opponents think a lot of people would have been supportive of a bill that only dealt with brewer said but when you open the possibility that the law is going to extend to people who want to go hunting or want to lend a gun to a friend that raised red flags with people bill with the maine gun safety coalition said including loans in the ballot initiative was consistent with the goal of closing a loophole that allows prohibited persons to acquire guns without a background check whether through purchases loans or trades like farmer said he was disappointed with the outcome but pleased that question had raised awareness of and conversation about the background check loophole and that could help address the issue down the road he said we gave it a heck of a fight and the issue going away said said there are opportunities for bipartisan collaborative work to address the issue of guns falling into the wrong hands for instance said he would like to see the federal government aggressively pursue and prosecute individuals who lie on background check forms or act as straw purchasers to illegally buy firearms for others but is not interested in another debate over background checks they made a run on gun control ran on it and they lost said and think that sends a pretty clear message particularly to the democratic party the demand came in the form of some letters mailed out to owners of registered long guns that are in violation of a city ordinance the first option for the letters recipient is to immediately surrender your rifle shotgun to your local police precinct and notify this office of the invoice number the firearm may be sold or permanently removed from the city of new york thereafter am not especially proud to be an american just now indeed am looking around for a button saying id rather be a canadian where leads as the economist editorialized a small and very decent nation which has admitted far more syrian refugees than we to our shame are willing to living in a maine country town can agree that yes rural maine needs to be paid attention to as to its needs as well as to both as virtues and its warts its warts include some which contributed to the defeat the of question the defects of the virtue of american individualism which include putting my rights above all other considerations including the right to life of children in places like ct and our larger cities rural maine like rural areas elsewhere also too often suffers from a related parochialism that defines neighbors as those in proximity or of like mind have a different standard one set forth by the poet john donne centuries ago each death diminishes me am not an island but part of the whole rural who voted no on question which would at most have caused minor inconvenience did so out on the basis of lies and distortions put out by the and its maine surrogates they also voted out of a devotion to maine traditions which are nothing to be proud of theres a big world out there put aside rush and get acquainted it was not a mere slight inconvenience it was an unworkable unenforceable and completely useless attack on law abiding people threatening to put them in prison for years by calling a safe harmless activity that harms no one a crime imagine if citizens had to drive to a car dealership and get a background check on a person borrowing or buying a car and then another on themselves before getting their own car back some close family members would be exempt but not your sons girl friend or fiance your first cousin is okay but not her husband or their kids it would even apply to a coworker who offered to drive you home from the doctors after having your eyes dilated its like that but maybe it would save one life two background checks would only cost between each time they wanted to borrow and return the car reasonable right poor people well sorry they just be able to have access to a vehicle then small sacrifice right it will make the collective safer who cares about the individual who might be slightly inconvenienced the firearm community includes guides hunters self defense collectors safety instructors accessory industry and competitive shooting sports we frequently loan borrow have work done on trade buy and sell firearms between trusted friends and extended family for lawful purposes safely and responsibly if not part of that community you understand criminals primarily obtain firearms through straw purchases background checks are secondary sources are theft and trade or buy from other criminals this makes up of gun access for criminals
