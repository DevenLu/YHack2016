as this everlasting election cycle winds down none too soon thought would focus on a single issue in the assault on our second amendment rights have watched participated in and listened to debates on this subject and the opinions on its impact are all over the map some people think it will have no effect on law abiding citizens while others insist it will only affect the people who follow the law happen to fall in the latter group it is a bad proposal that would have never stood a chance in the maine legislature and that is why it is offered as a ballot initiative and being marketed to voters with millions of dollars even democrats acknowledge this there is an important part of this debate that keeps getting lost and to me it is one of the most important facts regarding this issue while we are constantly told this is a simple background and that the no on campaign is lying about the dangerous consequences of this law let me pose a single concern that they are unwilling to discuss theft of our rights theft it is that simple if question passes the right to self preservation is being stolen from our citizens specifically those between ages this is one of the most concerning part of this question and have yet to see anyone else address it if you are not familiar with what am talking about will help right now as it has been for over years in maine it is perfectly legal for those citizens from years old to apply for and be granted a concealed pistol permit it is also legal at this age under maine law to purchase this type of firearm so far so good right this is where nanny is really putting the screws to our young adults by forcing every firearm sale transfer loan etc to be processed through a federal firearms dealer each sale is bound to federal law federal law dictates that no transfer of a handgun will be permitted unless the applicant is at least years of age passage of question will disallow the sale of a handgun to anyone under the age of in maine now think about the maine constitution specifically article section where it states every citizen has the right to keep and bear arms and this right shall never be questioned read it again paying especially close attention the last half of the statue that right shall never be questioned does restricting firearms purchases to any demographic under any circumstances fall under questioning of a constitutional right it certainly does bet those political interest groups expect those of us in maine to have such simple and easy gun laws and such a strong constitutional provision to go with our extremely low crime rate given this it is hard to believe that question could stand a constitutional challenge the proof is right here in black and white and his paid volunteer cronies are actually taking a constitutional right away from us through question and they are using maine voters as sheep in our own election
