Would love to see a poll of the rioters to see how many of them actually voted.
Rioters: "We need some mechanism for venting our outrage!" Founders: "How about voting?"
Thanks to all the heroes in the military - you keep our nation great no matter how badly we keep trying to screw it up. #VeteransDay

Hillary's dreams come to an end because of a weiner. Just as the prophecy foretold.
Hillary, 1999: I swear, I will never be undone politically by a penis again. People plan, God laughs. Then we all laugh. Because LMFAO.
Hillary: This scandal dies with Harambe. Harambe's ghost: Revenge me... *Weiner stops, listens to the wind, texts*
Hillary: Huma, I think we're in the clear. Huma: Unless Anthony somehow texts your emails to some 15-year-old chick. *Both laugh*
Hillary: Only a real Weiner could blow this thing. Weiner: You rang?
Comey: Hillary might be lying about her emails. Turn them over. Hillary: Comey's lying about my emails. Turn them over. Comey: Wait, what?
Hillary complaining about Comey's honesty over him not being transparent on her emails is my favorite story in years.
Note to Hillary: if you're fighting mad that Comey isn't turning over all your emails, YOU could do it.

Depressed over this election cycle? Relieve your depression by buying my new novel! https://t.co/0OO10Nt4eo
If the horror of that third debate eluded you, you've accepted this madness as the new normal. Don't. America deserves better.
Hillary Clinton fell apart under basic questioning from Chris Wallace. That she's winning this election is both a tragedy and a farce.
Hillary looked terrible because Wallace asked her real, substantive questions. Headlines won't reflect the depth of her awfulness.
Hillary's creepy killer clown smile is the giveaway she's been hit clean. Also that she lives in the woods.
Trump did better than expected in the debate. He also provided two headlines for the media he didn't need to. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
To pick up my new novel, click here -- it's surging up the charts, now #10 political thriller in America! https://t.co/0OO10Nt4eo
Oh https://t.co/uo5VN36SWf
Trump launched a lot of sallies, but very little in the way of a sustained attack, forcing her to answer. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary avoided every single attack on her. She has no answers. She's deeply corrupt. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Media headlines after the debate:  "Such a nasty woman" May not respect election results
Hillary: I've made children and families my life's work. Right -- destroying them. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary wants to expand entitlements and raise taxes. This is a recipe for bankruptcy. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump on Clinton: "Such a nasty woman." Fact check: True. Politics check: Stupid. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary says she'll build a Social Security wall and Trump will pay for it. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
THANK YOU CHRIS WALLACE FOR ASKING ABOUT ENTITLEMENTS https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary can't "invest" in the middle class. It's not a company. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary: I pay for everything I'm proposing. No, she doesn't. Also, we pay for all of that crap. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Chris Wallace must moderate every debate. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump is fine on taxes and regulation. Trump's obsession with trade deals is economically illiterate. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump says we'll grow our way out of debt. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary's answer on Syria incoherent as all hell. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
This debate is like watching two giraffes try to eat the same leaf, tangling necks, and strangling to death. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa

Trump's answer on "rigging" will the the takeaway moment. He absolutely blew it. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary says we won't use troops in Iraq. We'll use magical troops known as Special Forces, which aren't troops. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump's answer on this rigged business is patently politically insane. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump refuses to say he'll respect the election result. https://t.co/8QRnWk81iK
Trump keeps speaking in shorthand. He's launched about 10 solid attacks, abandoned them all. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Wallace asks Trump if the Foundation paid his legal bills. Trump says no, Hillary says turn over your taxes. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa

Hillary saying she only acted in America's interest...bulls***. How'd she and Bill pull down $100 million? https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary talks about a pattern of nastiness. Um, mirror, anyone? https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump says the other charges are false but he'd like to talk about ISIS. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary accuses Trump of promoting violence. Trump says Hillary caused the violence -- it's on tape. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump swivels to the emails, which he should have hit when Hillary was talking about Wikileaks. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
And the music swells... https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Everyone in every GOP household screaming "YOU ARE MARRIED TO BILL CLINTON AND ATTACKED HIS ACCUSERS!" https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary's giving the "I'm about to get indignant about sexual assault even though my husband is Bill" face. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Wallace asks Trump about sexual assault allegations. Trump says the stories have been largely debunked. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump smacks her over ISIS, and Hillary gives the deathgrin once more. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary tries to say Trump has a crappy career; Trump says he built a phenomenal company. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary desperately trying to trigger Trump by hitting his business record. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump name-checks NAFTA for the 1,985,341th time. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
If Hillary had been forced to talk issues this campaign, she'd be burned toast. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary admits that her actual positions are Obama's crappy ones, but with new crappy ones! https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Wallace cites Obama's economic failures; Trump can't let it go at that, says "thank you" to the moderator. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary talks about "investments" in new jobs. With your money. Because she knows best, apparently. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary says she won't raise taxes or increase the debt. That's total horsecrap. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary Clinton's a total horror show. Trump's babbling nonsensically. This has been the most substantive debate. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
So, who thinks that Trump is going to have a "lot of free trade"? https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump's economic plan leads with the idea that we must tell our allies to give us money. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Big winner thus far is Chris Wallace. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary talks redistribution garbage. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary babbles about command and control economics, which has failed everywhere. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump just imploded to defend his friend Putin. Wow. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary calls Trump a Putin puppet. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump was doing so well until he started talking about being besties with Putin. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump rightly smacks Hillary for pivoting off the issue. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
This would be an excellent opportunity for Trump to smack her on her private server. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
As Andrew Klavan is fond of saying, when Dems don't like the scandal, they question the means of obtaining info. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Wallace the first moderator to hold Hillary's feet to the fire. Good on him. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump says Hillary wanted the wall. She gives the demon smile. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump's most fluent on this issue. Hillary's most demagogic. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary Clinton on late term abortion is ghoulish. It is deeply depressing to have Trump be the one up there. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump was right, but he knows nothing and therefore can't rebut Hillary's lies about what partial birth abortion is. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump just offered the single weakest defense of pro-life positions on partial birth abortion I have ever heard. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump struggles to say he'd appoint justices to overturn Roe, finally arrives there. She hits with talking points. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary says toddlers shoot people. Perhaps we should outlaw pools. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary spits out that 33,000 people die from guns. (1) It's not a disease. (2) Half those are suicide. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary: I respect the Second Amendment. AHAHAHAHAHAHAH https://t.co/8QRnWk81iK
It is amazing that leftists are able to create litmus tests about cases, but right-wingers are scared to do so. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump says Hillary will turn the 2nd Amendment into a small replica, like Mike TV in Willie Wonka. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Trump says the Supreme Court is what it's all about, as opposed to the hokey pokey. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa
Hillary says SCOTUS is about appointing magical godkings to defend the leprechuan fairies. As the founders thought. https://t.co/8QRnWjQpUa

This is all so unexpected that I predicted exactly this happening by the end of the week on Sunday.
I can't believe Paul Ryan and the cuckstablishment made Trump walk in on naked 15 year old girls over a decade ago. Damn, they're clever.
For the record, Bill Clinton fans don't get to complain about these Trump reports.
Given allegations Trump walked in on women in dressing rooms, he should probably just claim that he's always identified as a woman.
Spent all day repenting. I wish I were someone who had just avoided doing things that would require repentance, like Donald Trump.

Americans DO get to complain about Trump's disgusting rhetoric/activity. But only if they take it seriously regardless of the source. (/4)
Democrats don't get to complain about Trump's disgusting rhetoric/activity. If he changed his last name to Clinton, they'd ignore it. (/3)
Hollywood doesn't get to complain about Trump's disgusting rhetoric/activity. A huge number of them treat women the same way. (/2)
NBC doesn't get to complain about Trump's disgusting rhetoric/activity. They hired him for 11 seasons and knew. (/1)
that the REAL reason people don't like him isn't that he's a disgraceful turd tornado, it's that he's too hard-core anti-Clinton. (2/2)
