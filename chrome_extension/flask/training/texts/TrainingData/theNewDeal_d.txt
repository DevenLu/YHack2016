Canada.... Here I come!  #FuckAmerica
This sucks....  But RELAX.  Have a passport handy....  But RELAX.

Republicans blocked and obstructed Obama for 8 years, hindering most of his agenda.  Payback is a bitch.
I came around for Hillary and got in line, but I'm just going to say it...  Bernie Sanders would have won tonight.
Donald Trump is the anger vote.  We all tend to do dumb things when we are angry that we later regret.

If you've been married 3x &amp; accused of rape 3x by 3 different women, you probably shouldn't attack another man for affairs  #NeverTrump
Donald Trump has ripped off everyone he has ever done business with  What makes you think he won't do the same to the American people?
Donald Trump has been taken to court 3 times on rape charges  If Trump wants to bring up Bill Clinton's affairs, he should think twice.
I dare Donald Trump, who has been married 3x and cheated on his first two wives, to bring up Bill Clinton's infidelities  Go for it.

If you support Bernie Sanders' agenda, just know that Trump is the exact opposite of that  Trump is everything Bernie is against.
Trump will privatize Medicare &amp; Social Security, dismantle Obamacare, cut taxes for millionaires &amp; do nothing to stop climate change
I supported Bernie Sanders in the primary  But I'm not bitter enough about it to give the country over to a con artist lunatic
I love Ralph Nader, but his candidacy in 2000 gave us George W. Bush  Johnson &amp; Stein could give us a President Trump  Vote Wisely.
Gary Johnson or Jill Stein are not going to win  Its not a protest vote, its a throw away vote  A vote for them is a vote for Trump

Bernie Sanders is voting for Hillary  I can't imagine anyone being more disappointed about the primary than him  It's called patriotism
I'm voting for Hillary Clinton.  I will not be responsible for a Trump Presidency.   Call me what you will... But #NeverTrump.
To not vote or throw your vote away because you supported Bernie to spite Hillary will get us Trump.   That's not a chance I can take.
I supported Bernie 110%.  While I have disagreements, Hillary is far closer to my views.  Trump represents everything I despise.
Fellow Bernie Supporters,  We have to ask ourselves if we are really willing to sit this out &amp; allow a moron to be President  I'm not.
Leave it to Trump to turn the Presidential election into a tabloid sideshow  See: Gennifer Flowers
Trump invites Gennifer Flowers to the debate...  Because class isn't something he has.
In response to Gennifer Flowers, Hillary should invite the women Trump raped to the debate.

Eisenhower was the Last Great Republican President  The Right Holds Onto Reagan b/c Ike Would be Considered a Raging Socialist Today
The Economy of the 1950's is a Prime Example of How Democratic Socialism w/ Well-Regulated Capitalism Creates a Strong Middle Class
In the 1950's, the Rich Paid 90% in Taxes Under a Republican President  The Rich Were Still Rich &amp; Our Economy Has Never Been Better
Under Republican President Eisenhower, the Rich Paid 90% in Taxes &amp; He Used the Revenue to Build Highways Across America &amp; NASA  #SOCIALIST!
I don't mind criticism from Conservatives &amp; Hillary supporters  It's just concerning that it's getting harder to tell them apart anymore

Every election is important, but this one is definingBernie wont run againIf corporatism wins, it will be the new standard for a while
What many fail to understand is that I hope I'm wrong about HillaryIf she wins, I would much rather be wrong than what I think will happen
I Voted for Gore, Kerry &amp; Obama Twice. PROUDLY.  I am Not an Angry Anarchist Emo-Prog.   I am One of Many That the Democrats are Abandoning
I Don't Support Corporatism  The Democrats Embracing it in Hillary Does Not Make it Any More Appealing, Actually Makes it More Terrifying.
I'm not turning on democrats by not supporting Hillary, I don't support Hillary Because I am a democratThe party is leaving me.
Unfollow Me If You Must, but When Hillary Turns on You for the Banks and Corporations That Make Her Run Possible, Remember Who Warned You.
I'm Just a Twitter Account, but I'm Warning You... Hillary is a Huge Mistake  If She Doesn't Lose, She Will Destroy the Party by Winning
Hillary Clinton is a Giant Leap to the Right for the Democratic Party  She Makes Obama Look Like Karl Marx  I'll Have No Part of It.
I Will Not Support Hillary If She's the Nominee  Sorry, but I Don't Vote Republican... Even When They Parade as Liberals  #ImNotWithHer
