On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” host Bill Maher and former Obama adviser David Axelrod criticized people tweeting that President-elect Donald Trump is “not my president.”Maher said, “I scolded the other side when they did that, when Obama took over, and that’s not my motto. You know what, the time to rectify that was Tuesday. If you’re — either leave the country but if you’re an American, we only get one president.”Axelrod stated, “Donald Trump, we all excoriated him when he said I may not accept the results of this election. So, how do we lecture him and then say, but wait a second, now you won, and we’re not going to accept the result?”
