@brcollet @TheWeedWeeb I tend to agree with that, but society needs basic prohibitions against murder etc. I see this as the same territory
@brcollet That really doesn't make it okay. My point is the law already covered your concerns. The changes in 08 are disgusting imo.
@DragonNanoha Yeah usually snip or crush the spinal cord while still in the mother so it's legal.
@brcollet @sie_kensou77 @again775 Before the 2008 change to the law it was already legal if necessary to preserve the life of mother
I mean, look, if you want to argue for late term abortion, that's a whole other thing, but don't lie about what it is or try to be deceptive
@xlwiggs yes
@brcollet @TheWeedWeeb Whether or not people use it, they celebrate it as progressive &amp; good for women, which is my point.
@The_Happy_Soul Thanks for the feedback! I know some people dislike it, so it's nice to hear that.
@HarveyBarker5 @brcollet The only Australian state that publishes stats on abortion is South Australia. Vic, QLD &amp; NSW don't collect data.
https://t.co/eOrOkZywmi
@brcollet Depends who you ask. It's beside the point though. My point is the law here is that, so wrong to say 'nobody' supports it
@EnglishEmma After that you need two doctors to sign off on it, but can sue them if they don't so most will.
The state deliberately keeps no numbers/records on abortion, everything is 'estimations' based on agendas. https://t.co/fwUXpcrWOO
@Ruthina77 Doctors can refuse on conscience but they have to refer them to another doctor who can refer them, so basically just adds a step
@EnglishEmma Vic
&gt; for any reason, &amp; it's illegal for a doctor to refuse referral. People celebrate how progressive this is.
&gt; and saying "nobody supports full term abortion". False. In my state of Australia, abortion is legal up until the moment of birth &gt;
Really sick of the dishonesty of people saying late term abortion only refers to the removal of an already deceased baby from the womb. &gt;

@MrCSG75 Happy to if you'd like me to! DM me :)
@Arteltoe There are also people who are 'Muslim' by birth and tradition rather than belief though. Who are persecuted by hardline muslims.
@Arteltoe You can do that and also take in some refugees, it's just a matter of doing so sensibly.
@Arteltoe If we agreed to accept fewer, we could vet more thoroughly. We can't help nobody either.
@Arteltoe If asked, I would say I'm in favour of a ban, but there's more nuance to it than that.
@Arteltoe There's too many other factors. Troubles start when you import too many of them and they don't integrate and assimilate.
@Arteltoe Tamerlan Tsarnaev was known to be violent, particularly against non-Muslims. Should have been deported earlier.
@Arteltoe There are genuine refugees who are nominal/peaceful Muslims being persecuted. Fine with them. Any crime or terror links, deport.
@Arteltoe You're arguing against a position I don't hold.

@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt; a lot more nuanced than that. Obviously abuse is not acceptable. But consent is different in that context.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt; &amp; think it's "Once you marry someone they can do whatever they want to your body, too bad for you". It's &gt;
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace Understandable. Yeah it's an important conversation. I just think people are misunderstanding the argument &gt;
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace I would suggest that's extortion or something similar. The sex isn't the problem itself, the abuse is.
@spookylizard lol I think the idea is that people have internet friends coz they're disabled &amp; can't leave the house to make IRL friends?
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace Just whether or not that should be legally prosecutable as such (rather than as abuse, assault etc)
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace But I don't think anyone is arguing that one partner cannot 'rape' another in the sense of forcing sex.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt; more easily than at present. But I am not convinced that rape within marriage is useful as a legal thing.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace Yeah it is, for sure. I think men &amp; women should be able to access help &amp; support for leaving abusive rships &gt;
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace I realise that it's complicated and that marriages can be abusive. Not trying to downplay that at all.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace Of course, I know. But psychological abuse is grounds for divorce, &amp; potentially illegal on its own.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace Also, legally, how can you ever prove rape in marriage? Gets super messy and disadvantages men in courts.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt;does imply consent to a point. In the case of abuse, the abuse/assault is the crime. Not the sex.
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt; but I don't think that should be prosecutable in the same way as outside of marriage. I think marriage &gt;
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt; is different to that. I don't think it's rape for a husband to pressure his wife into sex. A dick move, yes&gt;
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace &gt; Assault is prosecutable &amp; grounds for divorce. But 'rape' as a legal concept of not gaining consent &gt;
@TheAuburnOne @TheSafestSpace I've thought about this a lot myself &amp; I get her point. Forcible, violent rape in marriage is assault. &gt;
