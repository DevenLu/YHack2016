Hey @Elaine_Quijano you asked Pence 8 challenging questions but only one to Tim Kaine  What did the Clinton's promise or threaten you with?
When Pence mentioned: Clinton Foundation Pay to play  "Deplorables"  Moderator interrupted Pence immediately.   Another Clinton loyalist.
Mike Pence WON #VPDebate
Who won?
Clinton's must have dirt on Tim Kaine. No one can actually believe what he is saying. #VPDebate
I am pro life because every life deserves a chance. Every life matters. #VPDebate
Every life deserves a chance to live.   Every. Single. Life.   #VPDebate
Did you know Roe VS Wade was judged without modern ultrasound technology? #VPDebate
News flash: partial birth abortions mean the baby is fully developed and can feel outright pain. #VPDebate
Hillary Clinton &amp; the Democratic Party supports partial birth abortions.   PURE EVIL  #VPDebate
Tim Kaine, the Catholic Church is against abortion, but you don't care about that it seems. #VPDebate
If Hillary cared so much about women why did she take $50 million from countries where women can't vote or drive? #VPDebate
Pence mentions illegally deleted emails   Moderator interrupts and changes subject.   2 VS 1  Reprehensible.   #VPDebate
Moderator: Mr. Kaine how will you defeat ISIS?   Kaine: Donald Trump must release his tax returns.   #VPDebate
Hillary Clinton took $50 million dollars from countries where women can't drive or vote. FACT #VPDebate
Geez the moderator loves to cut off Pence whenever he is attacking Hillary. #VPDebate
The Clinton CRIME Foundation accepted tens of millions of dollars from FOREIGN countries  in exchange of favors! Illegal! #VPDebate
Over 15 minutes spent on Russia.   Remember when Romney was called crazy for calling them an enemy? #VPDebate
FYI Bill Clinton "negotiated" the North Korean nuclear deal without "firing a shot"  How did that work out?   #VPDebate
Hey moderator why don't you bring up how Clinton sold out America for millions of dollars? #VPDebate
We payed a $400 Million ransom to Iran. Indefensible. Notice how the moderator interrupted Pence after saying this. #VPDebate
Bill Clinton brokered a "great" deal with North Korea. They now have a BOMB  Iran deal is worse. They are on the way to a bomb! #VPDebate
Pence is making Kaine look like a shady public defender for the Clinton Mob. #VPDebate
Tim Kaine boycotted Netanyahu's speech. Despicable. He is no friend of Israel! #VPDebate
I love how the left hates Ronald Reagan unless they are debating a Republican. #VPDebate
Pence is WINNING this debate! #VPDebate
When Kaine continually cuts off real debate and returns to personal attacks #VPDebate https://t.co/xk4F6fgI5x
Trump paid tens of millions in payroll taxes every year. The fact he doesn't pay taxes is total Bs. #VPDebate
Let's talk Russia:  Hillary sold uranium rights to Russia in exchange for millions of dollars to her foundation.
The Free World is stronger when America is stronger. Pence understands this. Kaine does not. #VPDebate
Kaine told the most obvious lie of the night. Clinton email scandal evidence was widely known, inexcusable. She is guilty as sin. #VPDebate
What is Aleppo? #VPDebate
Kaine bragging about the Iran deal is like a student bragging about his C- grade on a paper. This is unreal. #VPDebate
Bill Clinton met with Loretta Lynch days before the FBI "decision"   She was bribed, threatened, or bought off. #VPDebate
Pence brings up Clinton's email server, moderator immediately interrupts. #VPDebate
Hey Tim Kaine, discriminating refugees by country makes sense. Islamic terrorists aren't coming from Japan or Korea. #VPDebate
Did Kaine really accuse Pence of hating all Mexicans? Is this SNL? #VPDebate
ISIS openly admitted they are infiltrating the refugee pool. #VPDebate
ISIS exists because of the same weak policies that Clinton wants to continue. Simple fact. No cute lines can cover that up. #VPDebate
Every enemy of the United States is stronger, and richer than they were 8 years ago. #VPDebate
"Did you work long on that one?"  LOL  #VPDebate
The world is a more dangerous place. This is a fact. #VPDebate
Clinton/Kaine destroys the concept of rule of law in America  Lies to congress  Ignores immigration laws  Destroys evidence under subpoena
"I'll work together with you when you go back to the Senate."   #VPDebate
"We have a deportation force, and it's called ICE."   BAM  SAVAGE PENCE  #VPDebate
Did Hillary apologize to the BENGHAZI VICTIMS FAMILIES? #VPDebate
Pence is arguing for basic enforcement of current immigrations laws. This should not be political issue. This should be common sense issue.
BASKET OF DEPLORABLES   Mic. Drop.   #VPDebate
Notice that Kaine is trying to steer from policy debate to personal attacks. Pence wins on authentic dialogue. #VPDebate
Tired of debating what Trump said   Let's talk about what Hillary DID! #VPDebate
Big time solution to race relations:   SCHOOL CHOICE! Helps lift people out of poverty!   #VPDebate
Hillary and Kaine believes: keep stealing from future generations so we can get elected. #VPDebate
Social security is broken   Millennials know we will likely never see a dime  Kaine is attempting to twist reality #VPDebate
Trump built a business career by hiring thousands of Americans.   Clinton built a political career by selling out millions of Americans.
Hillary Clinton should be in prison.   #VPDebate
Tim Kaine has NEVER signed the front of a paycheck. Only the back. #VPDebate
LOL Kaine is actually trying to argue that we're better off economically due to Obama's policies. This is hilarious. #VPDebate
Kaine's "you're hired/you're fired" line felt weak and inauthentic. We need solutions, not sound bytes. #VPDebate
Washington not Wall Street created the 2008 financial crisis!! #VPDebate
Pence is right. We cannot fix the national debt until America's free market is unleashed, multiplying growth! #VPDebate
When Pence drops the "even Bill Clinton said Obamacare is broken" line #VPDebate https://t.co/Ggizx2pbcq
Watching Kaine defend Hillary's record as Secretary of State is like watching a crooked lawyer defend an obvious mobster in court. #VPDebate
Kaine quickly interrupts as Pence mentions obvious Clinton Foundation facts. Kaine knows he cannot win that debate! #VPDebate
Tim Kaine has an impossible job  Pretend @HillaryClinton has integrity   How can ANYONE defend the Clinton Foundation? #VPDebate
"The American people know we need to make a change." - @GovPenceIN   Clinton/Kaine would mean four more years of failed policies. #VPDebate
Mike Pence is a phenomenal full spectrum conservative who did an incredible job as Indiana governor.
Hillary picked Tim Kaine because he was one of the few who would allow her lying cheating stealing.   He helped build the corrupt machine.
If Kaine really wanted to make our country #StrongerTogether, he would stand for School Choice. Let's help our kids! #VPDebate
At Ohio State right now.  No Hillary signs or shirts. No enthusiasm. Students hate Hillary.   In 2012 Obama signs everywhere. Way different.

Socialists say "power to the people"   Ya, right. They really want power OVER the people!   -- Maggie Thatcher
I have found the most vocal opponents to school choice usually send their kids to private schools or live in nice areas.
The supposed failures of capitalism are still far better than the best "success" of socialism.

And let's be honest. This is just a publicity stunt because @Kaepernick7 is a low tier QB and failing quickly. He just wants attention.
Kaepernick has a right to make a total fool out of himself.   But his sponsors also have a right to drop him immediately. And they should.
.@Kaepernick7 hates the country that made him a centi-millionaire. Seems like he is really oppressed.

Why did Hillary create and use a secret sever?  The answer to that question shows you there was indeed intent to break federal law.
Hillary Clinton committed a felony by lying under oath in front of Congress. Prosecute her.
RT @Will_0004: Like I said, this next generation of Conservatives are a force to be reckoned with. #WeWontBeSilent #BigGovSucks
Emails were marked confidential.   She knowingly used private server.   She sent classified emails regardless.   This is gross negligence.
How does someone set up a private, secret, email server unintentionally?
Hillary signed documents forbidding her from using external severs. She knew and agreed to such statutes. She broke the law.
Question for Comey:   Did you notify Obama or Hillary before you made your announcement?   Did you meet with Obama the last 2 weeks?
We have to remember this was the Secretary of State. Not a mid level employee. She intended to shield her own emails from investigators.
Question for Comey:   Why did Hillary Clinton create her own personal email server? Did she intend to hide something from Dept of State?
.@jasoninthehouse is absolutely destroying Comey. Well done!
