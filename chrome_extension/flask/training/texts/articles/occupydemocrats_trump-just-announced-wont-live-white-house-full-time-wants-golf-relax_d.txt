Poor Donald Trump is in for quite a rude awakening. It’s clear that he never really considered what winning the presidency actually entails, because he has announced that he doesn’t want to live in the White House- or has any interest in governing at all.The New York Times  “Advisers told the Times that the president-elect would like to spend his weekends either in his Trump Tower home, his New Jersey golf course or his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida.”One of the most shocking remarks however, is Trump’s apparent resistance to the the responsibilities of his office: “The questions reflect what Mr. Trump’s advisers described as the president-elect’s coming to grips with the fact that his life is about to change radically.”Coming to grips with it?Sorry, Trump, you aren’t a child going through puberty. You are the president of the United States, a choice you actively chose to make. There is no “coming to grips” with it.But Trump’s childlike desire to dodge his responsibilities and just enjoy the perks of office don’t stop there.It was obvious from the start that Donald Trump’s candidacy was nothing but an elaborate massage to his hyperinflated ego and sense of self-importance. The magnitude of the appalling mistake the American people have made is simply mind blowing.America, meet your lazy teenager-in-chief.
