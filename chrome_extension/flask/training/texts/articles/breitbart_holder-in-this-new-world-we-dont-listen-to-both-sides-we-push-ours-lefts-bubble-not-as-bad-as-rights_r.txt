On Friday’s broadcast of HBO’s “Real Time,” former Attorney General Eric Holder stated that listening to both sides is not something we do “in this new world we have. We push our side.”After Holder said that he didn’t like watching Representative Darrell Issa (R-CA) on Maher’s show, and suggesting Maher “ban him.” Maher countered, “We have to listen to both sides.”Holder then said, “Not in this new world we have. We push our side.” Maher responded that one of the reasons Democrats lost was a failure to listen to both sides.Holder then said that that was one of the reasons Democrats lost, along with decisions made by the Justice Department.Later in the interview, Holder agreed with Maher’s statement that the left’s bubble isn’t as bad as the right, adding, “certain things permeate our bubble,” but that the right’s is “impenetrable.”
