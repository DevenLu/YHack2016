you have watched along with us as former secretary of state and many of her top aides treated the court process with contempt however we have remedies in the courts for these delaying obfuscating tactics last week for example we filed a motion to compel to answer three interrogatory questions she refused to answer under oath we submitted the questions to her under a court order issued by district court judge emmet on august in our brief we argue that failed to provide sufficient reasons for refusing to answer them and the limited reasons she provides do not warrant sustaining her objections refused outright to answer questions about the creation of her system her decision to use the system despite warning from state department officials and the basis for her claim that the state department had percent of her in her responses sent to judicial watch and the court on october refused to answer these three questions outright and responded times that she does not recall information concerning her system she preceded her responses by eight general objections and two objections to definitions the words object or objection appear times throughout the document submitted to the court and judicial watch in our motion to compel her to answer we argue interrogatory asks describe the creation of the system including who decided to create the system the date it was decided to create the system why it was created who set it up and when it became operational in our motion to compel we argue secretary objects and asserts that the interrogatory is outside the scope of permitted discovery however the creation of the system is squarely within the scope of permitted discovery understanding the basic facts surrounding the creation of the system is an integral part of understanding how and why it came to be used for state department business to date no witness has testified about these facts and the court specifically authorized interrogatories to enable plaintiff to gather this information secretary refusal to answer the interrogatory is therefore misplaced interrogatory asks on march assistant secretary of state for diplomatic security wrote in an information memo to your chief of staff mills that he cannot stress too strongly however that any unclassified blackberry is highly vulnerable in any setting to remotely and covertly monitoring conversations retrieving and exploiting calendars a march states that in a management meeting with the assistant secretaries you approached assistant secretary and mentioned that you had read the and that you get it did you review the march information memo and if so why did you continue using an unclassified blackberry to access your account to conduct official state department business secretary objected to interrogatory asserting that it concerned issues outside the scope of permitted discovery in our motion to compel we argue interrogatory does not concern issues it asks whether secretary read a memorandum about the general use of unapproved or unclassified blackberries and if she did read the memorandum why did she continue using an unapproved or unclassified blackberry the device by which accessed the account she used to conduct official government business a yes or no answer to whether she read the memorandum will not reveal any information the parties scope sought to avoid similarly if the answer is yes secretary explanation as to why after reading the memorandum she continued to access her account through her blackberry also will not reveal any information the parties scope sought to avoid the interrogatory clearly seeks information squarely within the scope of permitted discovery secretary should be compelled to answer interrogatory interrogatory asks during your october appearance before the house of representatives select committee on you testified that to percent of your were in the states system and if they wanted to see them they would certainly have been able to do so identify the basis for this statement including all facts on which you relied in support of the statement how and when you became aware of these facts and if you were made aware of these facts by or through another person identify the person who made you aware of these facts secretary objected to interrogatory and asserted that the interrogatory asked for information protected by the privilege in our motion to compel we argue interrogatory does not seek any factual information secretary may have provided to her attorneys in confidence for purposes of obtaining legal advice nor does it seek any advice secretary attorneys may have provided the secretary that would reveal facts she provided them in confidence the interrogatory only seeks the factual basis for a specific representation secretary made to congress it is irrelevant whether secretary told her attorneys about the factual basis for this representation either for purposes of obtaining legal advice or for some other purpose because plaintiff has not asked about any such communications as a result the attorney client privilege does not apply because secretary has failed to provide any such information to justify her assertion of the attorney client privilege she should be compelled to answer interrogatory by refusing to answer our simple questions is obstructing judicial efforts to get basic information about her practices because she has not and cannot demonstrate that her refusal to answer our questions is proper should be required by the court to answer them promptly the responses to were received in the judicial watch freedom of information act lawsuit before the district court for the district of columbia which was first filed in september seeking records about the controversial employment status of former deputy chief of staff to watch department of state the lawsuit was reopened because of revelations about the system in the same cases we also filed another motion to compel against john former state department director of information resource management of the executive secretariat to answer questions asked of him during his october judicial watch deposition concerning former secretary of state system at the deposition answered each of the questions on advice from my legal counsel decline to answer the question and invoke my fifth amendment rights judicial court filing refutes claim for fifth amendment protection arguing judge allowed us to depose in the first place in part because of his notable appearance in a may inspector generals report that found mr told employees in his office that secretary arrangement had been approved by the state departments legal staff and also instructed his subordinates not to discuss the again it should disturb americans that yet another it official asserted the fifth amendment rather than answer questions about scheme you can see why this scandal will continue for long time though election day has passed
