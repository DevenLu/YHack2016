conservative talk show host and agitprop master beck has undergone quite an interesting evolution during this election season beck has turned against republican nominee donald trump and the wing of the republican party that he helped cultivate that change in perspective has culminated in outstanding praise for president did a lot of freaking out about made me a better man he says that he regrets calling the president a racist and even says that a black lives matter supporter there are things unique to the experience that cannot relate to had to listen to them forgive us if we take becks sudden conversion with a grain of salt to give you a snapshot of becks former self the new yorker notes that decency is a fresh palette for beck who at fox used to scribble on a chalkboard while launching into conspiratorial rants about looming hyperinflation ties to radicals with schemes and a cabal itching to take over america he once described as a stereotypical bitch and accused of being a racist with a hatred for white people beck played a significant role in encouraging the paranoid delusions of the conservative saying things like know where is from think from where they issue birth certificates think from hell and we already have happening in some have islamic law happening in some parts around the world including america or as writer brandy put it but it just goes to show how the motivating forces of the is becoming increasingly uncomfortable with the monster that created and to be fair not wrong about trump this guy is dangerously unhinged and for all the things people have said about me over the years should be able to spot dangerously unhinged from one unhinged to another
