the election of donald trump to the presidency is nothing less than a tragedy for the american republic a tragedy for the constitution and a triumph for the forces at home and abroad of nativism authoritarianism misogyny and racism trumps shocking victory his ascension to the presidency is a sickening event in the history of the united states and liberal democracy on january we will bid farewell to the first man of integrity dignity and generous witness the inauguration of a con who did little to spurn endorsement by forces of xenophobia and white supremacy it is impossible to react to this moment with anything less than revulsion and profound all along trump seemed like a twisted caricature of every rotten reflex of the radical right that he has prevailed that he has won this election is a crushing blow to the spirit it is an event that will likely cast the country into a period of economic political and social uncertainty that we cannot yet imagine that the electorate has in its plurality decided to live in trumps world of vanity hate arrogance untruth and recklessness his disdain for democratic norms is a fact that will lead inevitably to all manner of national decline and suffering in the coming days commentators will attempt to normalize this event they will try to soothe their readers and viewers with thoughts about the innate wisdom and essential decency of the american people they will downplay the virulence of the nationalism displayed the cruel decision to elevate a man who rides in a airliner but who has staked his claim with the populist rhetoric of blood and trump ran his campaign sensing the feeling of dispossession and anxiety among millions of voters in the main and many of those all but trump because they saw that this slick performer once a relative cipher when it came to politics a marginal buffoon in the of eighties and nineties new york was more than willing to assume their resentments their fury their sense of a new world that conspired against their fascism is not our cannot be we cannot allow it to be this is surely the way fascism can was a flawed candidate but a resilient intelligent and competent leader who never overcame her image among millions of voters as untrustworthy and entitled some of this was the result of her ingrown instinct for suspicion developed over the years after one bogus scandal after another and yet somehow no matter how long and committed her earnest public service she was less trusted than trump a man who cheated his customers investors and contractors a hollow man whose countless statements and behavior reflect a human being of dismal mendacious and bigoted his level of egotism is rarely exhibited outside of a clinical environment surely such a cruel and retrograde figure could succeed among some voters but how could he win surely news a site of vile conspiracies could not become for millions a source of news and mainstream the information loop had been shattered on articles in the traditional press look the same as articles from the conspiratorial media spokesmen for the unspeakable now have access to huge audiences this was the cauldron with so much misogynistic language that helped to demean and destroy the press was the purveyor of constant lies propaganda and conspiracy theories that trump used as the oxygen of his campaign steve a pivotal figure at was his propagandist and campaign but despair is no answer to combat authoritarianism to call out lies to struggle honorably and fiercely in the name of american is what is left to do that is all there is to do
