the chairman of the house tea party caucus and one of the first men to come out against speaker john a told news that he does not think speaker paul has the votes to keep his gavel just think he has the votes said rep timothy a who lost his primary and returns to private life after this session of congress said he is concerned that the house republican leadership is in a hurry to first get itself inside the conference and then to proceed with an aggressive lame duck agenda many house conservatives have called for the leadership elections to be moved forward from the scheduled event he said it is important to watch what the leadership does before returning majority leader majority whip steve and republican conference chairwoman cathy to their posts he said the conference elections are by voice vote which masks the weakness of support with house republicans and could be chaotic if and when he fails to reach the required votes when the new congress meets there is no doubt has the support of the majority of the conference but we will not find out if he has enough until january he said you got to have the congressman said just because you have get you said he does not know who could possibly emerge as a rival to but that also does not matter because the house rules do not require an opponent for someone to lose all that is required is the threshold was surprised over the years that when was on the ropes no one would step forward the congressman said paul he wanted it and he got it it was also a surprise to that the chairman of the house finance committee rep a former chairman of the house conference never made a run for it was always the guy that thought would do it could do it and would have had the votes he said loves his job but he knows the leadership will never let him take on is the financial services reform legislation wall street reform and consumer protection act which also created the consumer financial protection bureau the kansan said that in the lame duck session itself he expects to see two bills come up that no one is sales tax and the partnership trade deal negotiated by president with our pacific trading partners before the current recess the speaker led house republicans to believe that he would not push for the deal but said if you read between the lines actually left the door open he said it was not good enough it needs to be needs this it needs he did not say we are not going to do for six years republicans have blocked democratic attempts to pass an sales tax that would circumvent the supreme court quill decision which ruled that the quill office supply company was not obligated to collect sales taxes for states other than the state in which it was located said there is an sales tax bill all ready to go written by the staff of the house judiciary committee and supported by the leadership the tax bill is set to be sprung without warning he said no discussion before we went home no discussion of that at all not on the like a typical insider lame duck deal for his own the congressman said he is ready to make a privileged motion forcing a vote on the impeachment of the commissioner of the internal revenue service in september and his fellow member of the house freedom caucus rep john fleming a candidate for the senate were ready to make the motion but the night before they had planned to execute the plan he announced that they would wait until after the election one of the reasons house conservatives were counting on and fleming was that both men were leaving the house at the end of the session and would be immune from retribution from the house republican leadership because the motion is a privileged motion it must be voted on at once without debate or amendments but capitol hill sources have speculated to news that leadership looks to table the motion either in a vote or decision by the presiding officer said it was not his decision to stand down but he went along with it because other conservatives begged him not to go through with it owing to the extreme pressure they were receiving from the leadership was strongly discouraged by house freedom caucus members who said now is not the got an understanding with paul and the rest of the it was all at the last minute he said thought it was a mistake not to do it but do it out of respect for those who have to deal with paul a part of him suspects that the real reason members of the house freedom caucus lost their nerve was that they were afraid they would win he said regardless of the deals made in september said he is making the motion for impeachment when congress returns from its current recess and before congress leaves for its thanksgiving recess the congressman who holds a in agricultural legislation said he has not decided if he will run for congress again after his term ends he is convinced he was right on the issues but he could not overcome the million from outside the district that overwhelmed the voters beyond his own ability to get his message through am not sure what am going to do
