recent days have seen a rash of from liberals holding the left accountable for the election of donald trump some of this is solipsistic a symptom of the very same bubbled thinking these liberals have realized is a problem delivering trump and his voters a backhanded insult by saying errors made by their own side were the primary determining factor in the election still there are valid insights to be found in these articles some of them probably quite painful to express a bit of digging is required to find the insights in thomas franks piece at the guardian for example because he spends the first few paragraphs howling about how awful donald trump is once that primal scream is out of his system the author of whats the matter with kansas a book whose thesis was that folk were foolishly voting against their own material interests by supporting conservatives frank allows there was a reason that tens of millions of good people voted for trump and hopes he was serious about pledging to drain the swamp of corruption then he lays into democrats for choosing as their candidate chastising them for their obsession with credentials and their blinkered fealty to the political pecking order why oh why did it have to be yes she has an impressive resume yes she worked hard on the campaign trail but she was exactly the wrong candidate for this angry populist moment an insider when the country was screaming for an outsider a technocrat who offered when the country wanted to take a sledgehammer to the machine she was the democratic candidate because it was her turn and because a victory would have moved every democrat in washington up a notch whether or not she would win was always a secondary matter something that was taken for granted had winning been the number one concern several more suitable candidates were ready to go there was joe with his powerful plainspoken style and there was sanders an inspiring and largely figure each of them would probably have beaten trump but neither of them would really have served the interests of the party insiders and so democratic leaders made their candidate even though they knew about her closeness to the banks her fondness for war and her unique vulnerability on the trade issue each of which trump exploited to the fullest they chose even though they knew about her private server they chose her even though some of those who studied the foundation suspected it was a sketchy proposition to try to put over such a nominee while screaming that the republican is a monster is to court disbelief if trump is a fascist as liberals often said democrats should have put in their strongest player to stop him not a party hack chosen because it was her turn choosing her indicated either that democrats mean what they said about trumps riskiness that their opportunism took precedence over the or maybe both frank slams the media hard as well for pushing in ways that rang false to even casual news consumers since the public clearly equally in love with this peerless leader clad in saintly white voters came to see her glowing media coverage as hostile and condescending toward them as frank puts it the implication of much coverage was that only botched humans and racists would choose trump over which alienated much of the audience maybe its time to consider whether theres something about shrill shouted from a position of high social status that turns people away frank modestly suggests he also criticizes the democratic political establishment for growing complacent and assuming their vital constituencies have nowhere else to go and no role to play except to vote enthusiastically on the grounds that these democrats are the last thing standing between us and the end of the world this theme was taken up with brio by jim at slate who dismissed the moribund democratic establishment as a joke the midterm losses that was just a bad cycle structurally speaking presidential demographics would make up for it the party establishment made a grievous mistake rallying around it just a lack of recent political seasoning she was a bad candidate with no message beyond heckling the opposite sideline she was a total misfit for both the politics of and the energy of the democratic party as currently constituted she could not escape her baggage and she must own that failure herself zings the media for listening to democrat operatives who claimed had a lock on the electoral college but know what they were talking about he blasts the insular democratic party establishment for indulging sense of entitlement media handlers for assuming she was because shed been involved in so many scandals over the years crack election analysts who realize needed to visit wisconsin while trump was storming the rust belt and commentators himself who overestimated the schism in the republican party while failing to notice the democrat that was brewing most of those criticisms could be leveled at conservative media as well the democrats growing demographic lock on the electoral college for instance is accepted as grim reality by a lot of people who are profoundly unhappy with it critics of trump have been running all sorts of scenarios both before and after election day to argue that other candidates could have done even better than trump did they should consider the possibility that trump shook up the electoral map in a way none of the other candidates could have which of them was going to win wisconsin ohio and pennsylvania and make minnesota a squeaker some of the other candidates could have won in different ways in part because was a uniquely awful candidate but for many of them the tired democratic assumptions about the electoral map that assails would have been essentially correct point about the lopsided media emphasis on republican civil war is interesting too was that partially because the conservative movement appeared disproportionately strong on social media and so many reporters form their political impressions by studying social media these days republican voters largely came home to trump in the end and democrats mostly came home to despite many of sanders supporters loudly stating they would never vote for her however many democrats stayed home weakness with democrats was her undoing is correct to argue that liberal medias prejudices prevented it from understanding that not only was there a democrat schism but in the end it was more serious and immediate than the republican schism the question going forward will be how much of this was due to personally and the way she firmed republican resolve while disenchanting so many democrat voters thinks the sanders elizabeth warren wing of the party is the future which will only be true if more americans forget what socialism really is maybe venezuela will be out of the news by the wall street journal finds some democrats staggering through the ruins of the election looking for a more fresh and inclusive approach which is funny for a party that was bragging about its youth and diversity the day before it collapsed one democratic quoted by the bizarrely complained about how the party leadership was too old to attract young voters which would certainly come as news to sanders the real problem is that democrats have little to offer young voters who are concerned about real and serious issues not the claptrap democrats obsess over young voters who are seriously thinking about career and family are the ones democrats need to worry about and sanders sure as hell have anything meaningful to say to them they seem to have fallen for argument that she could whip the private sector with tax increases until it started creating more jobs either the journal quotes rep complaining that democrat strategy boils down to raise a lot of money keep recycling the same consultants and pollsters and strategies and well be ok well were not ok thats a fair point but three days ago comparably hidebound republicans were laughing at donald trump for seeking guidance beyond the same old recycled consultants pollsters and strategies they were that trump pollster was out of her mind that trump was deciding where to hold his rallies by throwing darts at a map the establishments action plan was to throw in the towel on issues that only irrelevant white people in red states cared and now heres the wall street journal quoting a few democrats who are essentially arguing that their party has to grow more conservative and find a way to communicate with middle american whites if it wants to survive course most of the who appear in the piece want to move the democrats further to the left if that advice is followed donald trump probably wont have much trouble getting in will at news thinks the unbearable smugness of the press played a major role in trumps victory chastising big media for mocking the people who had a better sense of what was going on the audience for our glib analysis and contempt for much of the electorate it turned out was rather limited this was particularly true when it came to voters the ones who turned out by the millions to deliver not only a rebuke to the political system but also the people who cover it trump knew what he was he invited his crowds to jeer and hiss the reporters covering him they hate us and have for some time and can you blame them journalists love mocking trump supporters we insult their appearances we dismiss them as racists and sexists we emote on twitter about how this or that comment or policy makes us feel one way or the other and yet we reject their feelings as invalid its a profound failure of empathy in the service of endless posturing theres been some sympathy from the press sure the dispatches from heroin country that read like reports from colonial administrators checking in on the natives but much of that starts from the assumption that trump voters are backward and that its our duty to catalogue and ultimately reverse that backwardness fires a shot across the rest of the medias bow for entertaining yet another round of smug theories such as dismissing trumps victory as a by racists and sexists who cant handle the brave new world of fairness equality and progress he offers the interesting suggestion that has gotten much worse since the advent of social media platforms like twitter which has been a powerful incubator for their smugness because been watching rabid liberal mobs shut down dissenting opinions and imbibing deeply from biased that think they can end arguments with olympian decrees of absolute truth they falsely assumed the election would work the same way as a direct result we get it wrong with greater frequency out on the road we forget to ask the right questions we cant even imagine the right question we go into assignments too certain that what we find will serve to justify our biases the publics estimation of the press declines even further fewer than americans trust the press per gallup which starts the cycle anew argues put his finger on the big problem for liberalism the public distrusts big government and big media for good reasons the left greatly overestimated the publics ability to remember the pratfalls of where failure had no consequences and accountability meant mouthing the words take responsibility without meaning a single syllable of it they misinterpreted approval ratings as positive approval of his presidency when it was really a combination of the bad polling methods that got the election so horribly wrong and ability to personally evade responsibility for his many disasters he was pretty good at convincing people he was a hapless spectator to everything that has gone wrong since not many people wanted another four years of it and lacked his charm the repudiation democrats just suffered at the ballot box was so astoundingly comprehensive that its impossible to argue voters approve of the presidency actually his time in the oval office has been one long death march for his party which as pointed out in his fiery editorial really control anything any more is right to argue that a smug ideology is incapable of learning meaningful lessons from disaster frank is correct to warn that the democratic corrupt leadership was too busy rigging the primary in favor to study what their own voters were saying never mind what the hated republican electorate wanted the has problems too but nowhere near as intractable as the sickness democrats refused to acknowledge until they slid under the table and blacked out at a little past midnight on election eve on the bright side got four years for diagnosis and treatment and triumphant republicans had better not forget thats a long time in modern politics
