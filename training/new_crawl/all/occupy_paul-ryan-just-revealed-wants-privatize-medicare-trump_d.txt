the election results showed the american people foolishly repudiated the democratic party by not only electing donald trump as president but also by not voting against republicans running in congressional races when trump takes office next year he will do so with republicans holding majorities in both the house of representatives and the senate this has to the detriment of the entire nation emboldened the republican leadership to tear down the social safety next which was expanded under president administration speaker of the house paul was a guest on fox news and made it known he intends to use his power to dismantle medicare citing that the program has serious problems went on to spew republican talking points to attempt to justify the anticipated gutting of a program which provides funding for medical services to millions of americans said when became rewrote medicare rewrote medicaid so if going to repeal and replace you have to address those issues as well what people realize is that medicare is going broke that medicare is going to have price controls because of medicaid is in fiscal straits so you have to deal with those issues if going to repeal and replace medicare has got some serious problems because of those things are part of our plan to replace went on to talk about the independent payment advisory board which was created under the law whose purpose is to recommend areas where the government can save money by reducing payments to medicare providers the curious aspect is the independent payment advisory boards powers do not kick in until meaning if republicans wish to take advantage of the boards power they will not be able to fully repeal trump seems to be breaking with plan of fully repealing and replacing trump visited the white house for his face to face meeting with president and the two discussed many topics including heath care coverage suggested to trump that he not entirely eliminate the program as it has helped millions of america retain medical coverage when they previously were unable to gain coverage during the visit trump said either will be amended or repealed and replaced told him will look at his suggestions and out of respect will do that trumps statement is completely contradictory to his previous campaign promises as he said he likes very much the health care laws provision that prevents insurance providers from removing because of conditions one wonders how trump will balance his new rhetoric against his campaign rhetoric where he said in late july we will repeal and replace disastrous many republican supporters of trump ignorantly believe is a bane upon their existence while not knowing the program has saved of thousands of lives while saving billions of dollars in the process trumps plan to appease his base while keeping various provisions of the law will be a tightrope balancing act especially if he will have speaker breathing down his neck the tension between the two has been well documented trump called a weak and ineffective leader less than a month ago refused to fully embrace trump during the campaign and trump is known to hold a grudge and seek redemption against those who he believes have slighted him the unpredictability of trump leaves one at a loss for what if anything he will actually do but considering trumps track record whatever he does is almost certainly not going to be of benefit to the american people
