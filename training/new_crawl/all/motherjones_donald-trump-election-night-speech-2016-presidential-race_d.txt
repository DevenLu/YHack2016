In a victory speech given early Wednesday morning in New York City, Donald Trump promised to renew and rebuild America. "We will begin the urgent task of rebuilding our nation and renewing the American dream," he said, to constant cheers from thrilled supporters. Trump acknowledged Hillary Clinton's public service and campaign, saying his opponent had "worked very hard for a long period of time." He called for America to bind its wounds and unite under his presidency: "I pledge to every citizen that I will be president for all Americans, and this is so important to me."Trump spoke of his experience looking into "untapped businesses" all over the world and repeated earlier campaign promises: He would fix America's inner cities, rebuild infrastructure so it would be "second to none," spur economic growth, and cultivate "great, great relationships" with countries who are "willing to get along with us." "We must reclaim our country's destiny," said Trump. "We're going to dream of things for our country, of beautiful things, of successful things once again." Appearing alongside his family and the vice president-elect, Indiana Gov. Mike Pence, Trump appeared calm and on-script. The Associated Press and most major news outlets called the race shortly after 2:30 a.m. Wednesday, after Trump won key battleground states, including Pennsylvania."I can only say that while the campaign is over, our work on this movement is really just beginning," said Trump. "We're going to work immediately for the American people and we're going to do a job where you'll be so proud of your president—so proud—and I love this country, thank you very much."He left the stage to cheers of "USA, USA, USA!"Watch the full speech above.
