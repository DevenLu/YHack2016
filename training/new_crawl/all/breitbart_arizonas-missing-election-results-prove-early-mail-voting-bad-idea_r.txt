while its clear that donald trump will be the president of the united states it clear until thursday that he carried arizona a quarter of vote has not been counted a full day after the election because of voting a practice that the nation and should end its not uncommon after election day to have a state or two where the result is not announced for three or so days after the polls close out of states a couple might be within a percentage point or even a fraction of a point requiring a detailed count of lagging absentee ballots from military voters overseas where it can take longer to arrive and be sometimes resulting in recounts or court challenges bush gore in but as of wednesday night why had arizona not been called donald trump was leading by to multiple states with closer margins were called for either trump or on election night arizona has not because hours after the polls had closed fully percent of the quarter of all votes cast in the grand canyon not yet been counted thats due to voting roughly half of the votes cast in filled out at home and mailed in before election day arizona was finally called for trump on thursday but had the margin been closer we might not have known until the weekend the principal newspaper in arizona that since the election is over knowing who carried arizona this late in the game is just academic the process of voting is wrought with potential for fraud and abuse no election worker actually witnesses a voter filling out their ballot they arrive at election collection centers as over a million faceless envelopes with signatures and other verification measures voting is also fraught with potential for voter intimidation groups can acquire lists of people who receive ballots until arizona passed a law this year shady leftist send a team of three or four workers to help you vote and then collect those ballots themselves nothing keeps them from standing over a voter in the living room while the ballot is filled out or a person is not intimidated by the observers presence and votes for a conservative republican despite the after the ballot is collected it could end up in the instead of the election office the court of appeals for the ninth circuit held that this law is unconstitutional eloquent dissents by conservative in a case that is still ongoing and faces an uncertain fate before the current supreme court another problem with voting is that its often done as early voting in arizona theres election month not election day ballots go out and citizens can often vote before seen two of the three presidential debates and also before the vice presidential debate campaigns are conversation with the candidates during which time the nominees make their case to the voters debate each other respond to criticism and from the media when they bother to do their a lifetime of foibles and missteps which everyone has all this is laid before the voters who have time to process the information talk with each other ask tough questions and weigh the answers at the end of that conversation and vetting an informed electorate can choose the most powerful person in the world as well as over other elected offices at various levels of government except in states like arizona where fully of early votes are cast by mail within hours of those ballots showing up in mailboxes in early october people are voting when this examination process is nowhere near complete think of all that was learned about both trump and secretary during that last month think also of the news developments like the horrific premium increases in voters have a right to know all that and contemplate what these revelations mean before choosing who will lead them this is the rigged system the denounced during the campaign the right to cast a vote is accompanied by a right not to have your lawful ballot canceled out or diluted by an illegal fraudulent or corrupted ballot while there must always be absentee procedures for people who are not able to vote on election day that should be the exception not the rule and the law should start the process as late as possible so that voters can learn through as much of the campaign as possible before casting their ballot along with laws requiring voter id and proof of citizenship foreigners can get drivers licenses in every state and even illegal aliens can get them in some these measures can provide reforms to ensure that every citizens lawful vote is cast and counted fundamental election law reform is needed to safeguard the integrity of the ballot box and ensure an informed electorate president trump will have an opportunity to decide if he wants to tackle that issue to clean up future elections
