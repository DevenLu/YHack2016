immediately following the vote in june remain protesters took to the streets of london to demand the nullification of the vote we are the per cent they cried simultaneously acknowledging their minority status while drastically revising down their estimations of themselves from when many of them were part of the occupy protests chanting we are the per cent but soon enough the protests subsided in part those participating got bored but what should be concerning to the likes of donald trump is the far more nefarious activity that has risen up in its place for the left which is far more when it comes to matters of usurping people and taking over institutions protests are little but a forerunner or sometimes just a it is a holding pattern while they get their house in order which is why the protests sprung up immediately after the election right on cue and hardly grassroots inspired and it is also why on the morning of friday november you had senator tell on many of his ideas for example ignoring religious freedom in america and setting up religious tests for people entering the country we will oppose him celebrate the diversity of a celebrate our constitutional vision of religious freedom and so some of the ideas that trump has put forward well vigorously oppose within the chamber of the senate and house so far so expected but when asked since not the party in how will you actually stop what he wants to do the establishment tactics were perhaps accidentally revealed responded certainly for many of these ideas its going to be many of our colleagues across the aisle who also do not share the precise vision that or every element of the vision that trump put forward during his campaign will tell you one of the things very concerned about is the supreme court seat he appointment of this seat rightly belongs in the hands of resident hat the majority in the senate has done is to basically steal that from one presidency and try to deliver it to another which is going to greatly and profoundly affect the legitimacy of the supreme court a thats doing major damage to an essential institution in our constitutional vision do you see what the senator did there it was basically the same thing the democrats were goading donald trump about before the election hell even got quizzed about it by establishment journalists in london the legitimacy of institutions is now being called into question just because lost the election and not just any old institution arguably the most important in the system of government the supreme court in britain the establishment moved to undermine the legitimacy of direct democracy of the referendum itself not just by shifting the balance of power to a remain government but also in their latest ruse by using the high court to toss the decision back to a house of commons in the united states the protests will soon subside and give rise to something far more dangerous and just like the the protesters themselves if the establishment has to tear down everything around it in order to its control it will donald trump will need to safeguard against this and plans to combat such tactics must be devised right now
