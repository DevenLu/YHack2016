until this election nobody knew that north carolina was a state firmly committed to jim racism but today its been literally difficult to even pass several hours without yet another illegal scam to suppress minority votes being revealed a federal judge slammed north carolina elections officials in court today in a case filed by the where the us attorney general weighed in to let the bench know that if proven the allegations would show three major violations of the national voter registration act during oral arguments the judge explicitly called north carolinas voter challenge law a jim crow law like the ones which began in the and codified american apartheid in the south leading to the civil rights laws of the reports district judge said multiple times the challenge process sounds insane the says counties are violating federal law by removing voters less than days before the election this sounds like something that was put together in she told lawyers for the state the judge also said she was horrified by the number of removals in county which accounted for the majority of the statewide total it almost looks like a cattle call the way people are being purged she told county attorney rick clearly election boards and politicians in north carolina are only restrained by the spectre of federal enforcement via the mechanism of the voting rights act unfortunately since the moment that the supreme court decided to override the will of congress and gut the voting rights act in the impact of that willful act of judicial activism by conservative jurists has echoed in places where racism arrive with trump but festered secretly for decades waiting for the opportunity to strike the north carolina officials who conducted the purge said they were following a bizarre state law which the united states department of justice has already indicated that it believes violates the national voter registration act heres how republicans in north carolina purged voters from three counties who are mostly democrats under state law any voter can challenge another county residents registration resulting in a hearing where the challenger presents evidence according to a state legal filing if local officials find probable cause the challenged voter is given notice of a subsequent hearing a voter who rebut the evidence can be removed the lawsuit cites moore and beaufort counties where activists have challenged thousands of voters the challengers include volunteers with the voter integrity project which says it wants to guard against voter fraud in most cases cited by the lawsuit mail to a voter is returned as undeliverable which county boards can accept as evidence the voter live there the filed statement of interest on the side of the saying that if their allegations are proven true in court there would be three separate provisions of the national voter registration act apparently the judges reaction means that they made the case three limitations on the removal of voters are pertinent here a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a purported change of address outside of the jurisdiction using only mail returned as undeliverable and without following specific required procedures a jurisdiction may not remove voters based on a change of address within the same jurisdiction and a jurisdiction may not carry out a program of systematic removals within days of a federal election district judge is expected to rule in the case early tomorrow but it sounds like her opinion has already been made up after todays hearing north carolina voters are facing unprecedented political roadblocks this year and its all due to their state republican all out war against letting people vote it looks like the is getting nervous that nobody will vote for bigotry laws that have damaged their states economy so got to do everything they can to rig the election by preventing people from voting vs north carolina statement of interest by grant stern on
