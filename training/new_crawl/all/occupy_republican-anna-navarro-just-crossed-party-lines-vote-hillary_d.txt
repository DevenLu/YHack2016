republican ana is one of her most outspoken national commentators doing battle against the trump movement nightly on but not comfortable voting for either until now in this moving editorial she just revealed that the contents of her ballot included a vote for the democratic nominee and sixteen reasons why she had to cast her vote against the republican nominee donald trump voted against donald trump because am a republican accept that trump duly won the republican nomination but do not accept that he represents republican values not the ones respecting had hoped that a week before the election trump would be losing florida by a large enough margin that my vote matter but darn it my home state is too close to call florida could be the decisive state as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the united states thought back to the election which was decided by votes in florida thought about how would feel if the same thing happened in thought and thought and then cast my vote for ana was the national hispanic campaign chairwoman for republican presidential nominee john in impassioned reasons for voting for over donald trump were numerous in the word column she filed today but the most important reasons she noted is the republican nominees utter lack of moral character and disgusting personal behavior became a partisan because of her unique upbringing as a her father was a devout republican and was involved with the vicious contra terrorist groups that tortured raped and murdered their way across the jungle in their efforts to fight the communist government in the president ronald illegal support for the which culminated in one of the most appalling back door deals in our nations history the affair earned her father and thus young loyalty for those reasons it had to be an excruciating choice for her to make between supporting a party to which she has a visceral personal connection or voting for the only qualified nominee because it is her duty to america to choose the best candidate have been a republican since before could vote my family fled communism ronald reagan fought communism that sealed the deal for me have been an active partisan my entire adult life this is the first time vote against the republican nominee for president our founding fathers set up a government of checks and balances we can and have survived presidents with bad judgment but fear the effects on america of a president with bad character some tell me in we should no longer expect the president of the united states to be a role model refuse to accept that the president of the united states has to lift us all in moments of national grief the president of the united states has to hug the children and spouses of fallen soldiers that person represents us all that person is recognized as the face and the voice for america in front of the rest of the world and more importantly by our children a person supported by the and its former grand wizard david duke can never represent me he can never be a role model for me ana voice about the republican lost direction has been a breath of fresh air on throughout this years election and her rational take on the destructive racist candidate that the republican party nominated has been real accurate and true unfortunately shes a an immigrant and a woman so her party interested in accurately true comments nor is it interested in representing her either hopefully more republicans take heed of her call to vote for americas only qualified candidate for president democratic nominee because its the only right decision for our country
