despite questions about how things might have turned out if he had been the democrat nominee sanders dismissed that as a variable of the and insisted he would work with the so a key reason why donald trump won was his message that appealed to a lot of voters in states like wisconsin pennsylvania michigan very similar to your own message that you used throughout your campaign against for the democratic nomination if you had been his competitor thats a big if if you had been his competitor senator do you think you could have beaten him sanders think its makes a whole lot of sense to do right now the election is over donald trump won between you and me wolf would have loved to have had the opportunity to run against him but that did not end up being the case right now where we are is where we are intend to work with president trump on those issues where he will in fact work for the middle class and working families of this country will vigorously oppose him if he appeals to racism or sexism or some of the other discriminatory measures that he brought up during his campaign but it never crossed your mind that you might have done better against him you might have actually won if you had been the democratic nominee sanders what good does it do now you know the election is over and you know did my best to see that get elected was out in some states during the last week with think rallies so the election is over and got to look to the future and what we have got to demand think is that mr trump keep the promises that he made to working families remember wolf he talked about how he was going to be a champion of working families well hope he will raise the minimum wage so that people who are working for or bucks an hour get the kind of raise entitled to hope he will do pay equity for women women should not be getting cents on the dollar compared to men hope hell rebuild our crumbling infrastructure and look forward to working with him if he chooses to do that and create millions of jobs and on trade absolutely we need a new trade policy will work with him to get corporate america to start investing in this country not just in china and in mexico hope you know he told the american people wolf that he have to pay any taxes he is a he have to pay a nickel in federal taxes because he knows how corrupt the tax system is well if he knows how well that how corrupt that system is hope very much that hell work with progressives to create a tax system which in fact asks billionaires and corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes
