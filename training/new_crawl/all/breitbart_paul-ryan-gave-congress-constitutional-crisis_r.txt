reasons nick when pressed him on whether he would run to fill speaker job himself said somebody has to not saying will do it but we need change would rather give my vote to somebody who will support the platform upholds regular but if it came to that would do it the nation is facing a constitutional thanks to paul explained while noted that his own opposition to stems largely from procedural issues rather than specific policies other conservative lawmakers have expressed concern that policy agenda as well as his demonstrations of poor leadership throughout the election season have made him unfit to run the republican party in congress in particular some lawmakers have pointed to efforts to seemingly undermine trumps campaign last month congressman mark meadows said that a lot of conservatives question the loyalty of the speaker in light of treatment of trump and said that the push to remove as speaker was picking up some steam moreover on particular policies while himself has acknowledged that trump has earned a mandate from the american people trump was given a mandate to enact policies that stand in direct opposition to personal agenda on pivotal issues like trade immigration and crime for instance trump ran on a platform of immigration controls whereas has been an active champion of open borders according to pew polling data percent of the electorate oppose vision for expanding immigration levels and instead want to see immigration levels frozen or reduced similarly trump ran against globalist trade policies whereas supports the multinational trade policies backed by the republican donor class even worked as president partner to fast track the partnership agreement according to polling data from a recent politico survey percent of voters disagree with speaker vision on the issue of trade and believe that free trade has lost the more jobs than it has created told that while he was not initially a trump supporter he decided to get on the trump train after he became the nominee trump may have been the only one the republican candidates on that stage who could win pennsylvania and michigan while not losing florida and its got some interesting ramifications for the republican party said trumps victory represents an implosion of the republican party and maybe a realignment continued there has been a religion in the republican party and its called free trade and if you did anything to question some of the trade deals you immediately got branded as a theres always sort of been this a protectionist if you start talking about the rules of trump captured pennsylvania and michigan and rust belt if you talking about this issue and challenging some of those assumptions indeed by running against speaker agenda on trade immigration and crime trump was not only able to win the presidential election was unable to do when he was on the but he was also able to win home state of wisconsin was also unable to do when he was on the trump now has a mandate said particularly on the issue of immigration and building a wall along the southern border explained that if congress were to get in trumps way on this issue he believes the next stage will be pitchforks and torches in washington think there are a couple things that trump has to do and if he do these things or if congress gets in the way of him doing these things the next stage will be pitchforks and torches in washington one of those things is repeal and replace the other thing is think got to start building a wall got a mandate he said he was going to build a wall he got elected with over electoral votes and think its going to start happening or else some people are going to be very upset in recent days has ducked answering questions about whether he will now champion trumps proposed border wall along the southern border has also not said whether in light of trumps mandate he now recants his former statements denouncing trumps plan to enforce immigration law and allow ice officers to do their job by removing individuals in the country unlawfully was not surprised trump said and let me tell you something that really insults me and most of middle america is when the media keeps calling it a stunning upset how can it be a stunning upset if fully half of the country thought that he could or would win its not a stunning upset whats stunning is their inability to get outside of their bubble and see that he could thats not even stunning thats just par for the course for his part seemed to express surprise in the aftermath of trumps victory declaring donald trump heard a voice out in this country that no one else heard by no one else seems to be referring to beltway elites and party insiders including himself who failed to listen to the peoples desires on some of the most seminal issues addressed during the election and who instead championed open borders trade and immigration policies opposed by the republican and american electorate it is unclear whether the house freedom caucus led by jim jordan will support and allow him to remain as the republican leader in congress given the fact that stands opposed to roughly in voters on the key issues of immigration and trade
