the freakout is epic seen it friends relatives and colleagues posting that they are not only sad that donald trump won the election but actually physically afraid that he is going to round up all of them and send them to death camps some of the hysteria is just political posturing as every parent with toddlers knows throwing a tantrum is a way to constrain authority flipping out about trump is a way to oppose him but for others the fear is real heres how to calm them yourself down step realize you were lied to about trump being hitler guess what trump is not hitler and never was or will be you were also told that his supporters were racists rednecks etc you know who his most important voters really were the people who would have voted for sanders who wanted a political revolution and some of those are your friends trumps a flawed but decent man with a complicated but beautiful successful family going to be fine step realize you cant win every presidential election and thats ok its been a while since democrats lost so this bears repeating especially since who came of age with the campaign may never have voted for a losing candidate before marks the first time have ever voted for a winning candidate never voted for george bush or bill and survived until now at some point republicans were going to win again at some point so will you step read this thing called the constitution and learn to use it you bought one when khan waved one at trump open it theres actually some good stuff in there like checks and balances on the executive branch tried to destroy those checks and balances which is one of the main reasons we fought so hard to resist him and one of the reasons voters rose up against him as well as on tuesday use those checks against trump and you can stop his worst tendencies step realize there are some things did trump wont reverse if you like your gay marriage you can keep your gay marriage really trump supports traditional marriage but at this stage what that means is he will defend the right of a private business to refuse to participate in your lesbian union and you may have missed it but trump was the first nominee to talk openly about defending gays from persecution wont touch your birth control step expect immigration reform to look something like you wanted if you could ensure that most of the million illegal aliens currently in the united states would stay here but build a wall across the border to prevent any more from coming take that deal you because thats whats likeliest to happen and any deal on immigration trump makes will have more credibility than any deal makes just stop waving that mexican flag and it will happen step recognize that this is the best time in america to be a woman trump hired a woman to run his campaign and she delivered women were also in key positions throughout trumps campaign expect them to fill his administration and dust off your resume you might be sad about defeat but it means that the first woman to break the glass ceiling probably wont be someone who got a lift through marriage or who used public office to enrich herself thats a good thing step realize that you might be wrong about a few things the shock of trumps victory is a good time to evaluate some of your beliefs you can start with the assumption that everyone who opposed him was actually a racist half the country has different ideas and some of those ideas really are very good going to like paul budget for example and probably going to ask yourself why pass some version of it regardless this is a teachable moment use it want more good news check the stock market which first slipped then rose dramatically the day trump won look at what canada and mexico are saying about the governments of britain and israel our two closest allies are happy and trumps first meeting with went well if everything falls apart and it might given the big challenges our country faces you can replace trump in four years you have until then to find a better alternative in the meantime chill is senior at news his new book see no evil hard truths the left cant handle is available from through amazon follow him on twitter at
