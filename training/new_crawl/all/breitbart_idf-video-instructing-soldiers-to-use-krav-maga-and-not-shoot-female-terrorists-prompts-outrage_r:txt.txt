a new video instructing israeli soldiers serving in the west bank to avoid shooting female palestinian terrorists and use instead has prompted outrage in israel with people calling the new guidelines insane and delusional the clip produced by the brigade comes in response to the increasing number of palestinian women and girls attempting to carry out terrorist attacks and in particular stabbing attacks since the current wave of violence started over a year ago you can see it here the tutorial explains that the threat posed by female terrorists is smaller than that of their male counterparts coupled with the fact that the death of palestinian women at the hands of israeli forces only serves to heighten palestinian for revenge soldiers are instructed to try and engage the women in the contact combat known as first rather than resorting to their weapons critics have lambasted the move saying that soldiers would be putting themselves at risk since terrorists often carry explosives or other weapons on their persons citing hebrew news site the quoted one reserve duty officer as saying the new guidelines will only serve to further confuse soldiers we are liable to pay a heavy price for formulating such directives he said another military source said it was unrealistic to expect soldiers under fire to be able to make a quick distinction between male and female terrorists an attempted terrorist attack has to be thwarted regardless of considerations about the feelings of revenge aroused in palestinian society about dead female attackers this cannot be what guides our actions he said
