on thursdays news daily former ambassador and senior fellow john who is also the head of a political action committee told host that the opportunities are enormous going forward from donald trumps presidential victory just to start with the senate and the house he continued we apparently are going to lose two seats in illinois and new hampshire conceded yesterday we will win the louisiana seat in december almost certain of that so to emerge in what could have been a terrible year with only two losses is incredible where we did have losses joe heck in nevada and as mentioned in new hampshire they were two candidates who backed away from trump he continued supported both of them theres no doubt about it because they were strong on national security but they made a political error it been true for every candidate some in the house who distanced themselves from trump like barbara went on to win the state where we did worst was nevada where we lost two republican seats think because of the heck loss and the loss of the race at the presidential level to harry machine mused think about that nevada is a republican state got great young republican prospects there like attorney general adam paul grandson so even in a state where we did poorly this year the prospects for republicans are great so got a republican president republican senate republican house there is no excuse no excuse now to not make the changes in washington we want and by the way because of the aforementioned we will now have every prospect of a conservative supreme court and a conservative judiciary for the next generation if we blow this opportunity we deserve to win he warned agreed with that trump voters were far more educated and diverse than media caricatures portrayed them and the lefts attempt to those voters would come back to haunt them lets face it the conventional wisdom going into tuesday compared to the results we see now shows a massive failure by the political class massive unprecedented really argued and as you point out underestimating the american people this is to me perhaps the most important parallel to because in britain everybody who was anybody anybody who knew anything knew that britain had to remain in the european union just as in this country anybody with a brain knew that was destined to be the first female president and they were all flatly wrong got to say the disdain some of the people demonstrated not simply for trump but for trump supporters sent me over the overhead added you know a very lucky guy the first person in my family to go to college my father was a for the city of baltimore he never graduated high school my mother was a housewife she never graduated high school theres not the slightest doubt in my mind if they were alive today they would have voted for trump and to hear some of the not all of them but some of them pour disdain over that white working class portion of the population which is what my parents were just filled me with outrage so think its a great victory for the common man in america and that drives the political class wild too agreed with that basket of gaffe was a watershed moment because successful candidates attack the voters themselves no matter how hard they go after the opposing candidate and her husband were a year ahead of me in law school so known them for a long time and have to tell you in the early seventies at yale law school there might have been one or two conservatives on the faculty robert ralph winter ward bowman great professors there might have been about the same number of conservatives in the student body overwhelmingly democratic overwhelmingly leftist overwhelmingly convinced they knew better than anybody else recalled and id put right at the top of the list of the people who thought they knew better than anybody else she was destined destined to run the country her husband was not way by the way he was much more personable a normal easygoing kind of guy continued so when you are and you are a master of the universe smarter than everybody else you know whats good for them and if just do what you tell them to do feel so much better shed feel better the world would be happy the people said and again feel this was a parallel with thank you very much well run our own lives tell us what to do tell us what to think tell us what to say he concluded news daily airs on patriot weekdays from to eastern listen
