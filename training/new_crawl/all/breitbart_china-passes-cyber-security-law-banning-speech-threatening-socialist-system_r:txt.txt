on monday chinas parliament passed a law that has foreign businesses and activists nervous as it will place even more restrictions on chinas already tightly controlled when its practices are implemented next june many of these restrictions apply extra security measures against interests china is an power and as one of the countries that faces the greatest security risks urgently needs to establish and perfect network security legal systems declared parliamentary official yang as quoted by reports that efforts by concerned international groups failed to move chinas legislators more than global business groups petitioned chinese premier in august urging to amend what they said were controversial sections of the law chinese officials have said it would not interfere with foreign business interests contentious provisions remained in the final draft issued by the parliament including requirements for critical information infrastructure operators to store personal information and important business data in china provide unspecified technical support to security agencies and pass national security reviews those demands have raised concerns within companies that fear they would have to hand over intellectual property or open back doors within products in order to operate in chinas market chinese officials offered vague assurances that the new law complies with the standards of international trade does not discriminate against foreign companies and will not interfere with global trade in fact chinese director charged that critics who see signs of trade protectionism are guilty of a kind of misunderstanding a kind of prejudice this is the kind of argument that advocates for a free should be on guard for as control slips away from the united states the chinese are essentially arguing that heavy censorship is woven into their culture and critics are bigoted against that culture or at best ignorant of its nuances we believe this is a step backwards for innovation in china that wont do much to improve security said james chairman of the american chamber of commerce in china money quoted noting his criticism follows a string of complaints from foreign companies about a worsening business environment in china that favors domestic firms despite official promises to make the economy more open not every outside observer is completely unhappy with chinas actions china expert of the netherlands saluted for recognizing that immediately and profoundly impacts on many if not all aspects of national security it is a national space it is a space for military action for important economic action for criminal action and for espionage said notably chinese officials quoted by western media outlets apparently feel no urge to defend the intellectual censorship aspects of the new law the way they are offering assurances that it will not damage international trade human rights watch listed a number of objectionable features from the final draft of chinas law including requirements to censor prohibited information collect real names and identification data from social media users store important business data related to chinese operations on servers in china and provide technical support to chinese security agencies on demand all the way up to engineering massive network shutdowns in response to major security incidents notes that the final draft of the law expands chinese censorship to quash not only speech deemed to endanger national security advocate terrorism or extremism propagate ethnic hatred and discrimination but also to crush attempts at overthrowing the socialist system fabricating or spreading false information to disturb economic order or damaging national unity that is an warrant to silence just about any speech the regime in dislikes virtually all criticism of the regime could be classified as damaging to national unity and censored human rights watch notes that such broad standards are already used to punish and jail peaceful activists sometimes with lengthy jail terms those who operate social media platforms will be terrorized into becoming accomplices to censorship because they can easily be prosecuted for failing to meet the draconian monitoring and reporting requirements of the new law the chilling effect on dissident speech is profound the temperature of speech in china will drop even further once these censorious practices are codified in national law and enforced at the highest levels if speech and privacy are a bellwether of attitude toward peaceful criticism everyone including in china and major international corporations is now at risk this laws passage means there are no for users against serious charges said richardson china director for human rights watch
