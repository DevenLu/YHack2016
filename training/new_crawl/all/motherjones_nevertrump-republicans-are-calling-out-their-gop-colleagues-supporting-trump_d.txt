 It wasn't supposed to go like this. The polls showed Hillary Clinton with a small but stable lead. But as Donald Trump began to run away with the election on Tuesday night, the small band of #NeverTrump Republicans began lamenting the role their party played in electing him—and the future it helped create.Here are their tweets:With a not insignificant chance Trump is President right now, everyone in my party who enabled this should think about what they've doneRIP Classic Liberalism. 1750-2016All the Republicans who endorsed Trump on the assumption that he'd lose are not looking like history's finest public servants now.Maybe Mitt Romney and George W. Bush should have endorsed Evan McMullin or Gary Johnson.It may not be the end of the end of history. But perhaps it is the beginning of the end.On the bright side, 227 years is a really good run for a republic. Feeling bad about much much tonight, but feeling good about this.  I’d be ashamed now if I had flinchedI'm sad for what we have lost. Liberal democratic capitalism is dead for the foreseeable future in the GOP. But electoral facts are facts.
