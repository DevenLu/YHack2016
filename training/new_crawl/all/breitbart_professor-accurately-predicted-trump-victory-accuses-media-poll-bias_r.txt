stony brook university professor of political science returned to news daily on friday morning two weeks after standing by his prediction that most polls were wrong and donald trump was highly likely to win the presidential race professor was feeling rather good about that prediction on friday also confirmed in response to host first question that it is indeed awesome to have a name like and to hear it repeated with such gratitude and appreciation just gone through a ton of congratulating me and saying how happy people were that made that prediction that when it looked pretty difficult that it would come true stuck to it it made a lot of people happy that makes me happy he said however said he was not receiving any apologies from the political analysts and media outlets that said he was crazy for predicting trumps victory nobody ever apologizes for these kinds of things he mused thats just the name of the game expect that but happy to get the congratulations and know deep down how they must feel that they thought was just ridiculous and absolutely wrong would fall on my face etc thats good enough for me to know that said the election was a new phenomenon and trump was a candidate unlike any other in recent memory think the polls just totally misjudged the potential and the kind of support that he engendered and he just fell through the cracks of how they poll people how they wait whatever they get from the polls to make a sort of forecast of the electorate and it was just so way off he said any time looked at a poll at some of the fine print about the breakdowns to see what they were weighting always saw a very heavy democratic preponderance which thought was way off even bigger than in so had a feeling right away that that be true that we get an electorate that was just like that and so always figured that trumps chances were much better than these polls indicated when they report for example how many democrats they have in the poll how many republicans independents usually if they do that many many do that of the kind of they call the electorate the likely voters and they tell me like abc washington post follow them pretty closely at some points they had leads of ten points ten percent more democrats than republicans and in the end it was four points knew four years ago it was only six so ten points was just way way off and so if you made an adjustment for that you could see right away how that would narrow explained just feel very skeptical about the way that they handled the information that they get from polls he declared when asked if there was any method for keeping these people in line for future polls laughed and asked if he was referring to the pollsters or the voters on the assumption that pollsters truly want their surveys to be accurate rather than using deliberately slanted surveys as tools to manipulate public opinion predicted a pretty thorough investigation of the polling business think very concerned about that because this kind of polling is very important to them its sort of a public benchmark about how doing with other things if people can see that something happens in real life that you can sort of check against what doing then some people might be sort of skeptical about doing business with them he said remember gallup after that last election gallup had done this business for years and you did figure gallup really knew what it was doing decided to quit this type of polling he recalled so you see gallup any more and think thats a sort of a real sad commentary on the business professor discussed his prediction model in more detail in an published at on thursday this is how change trumped experience in his new book franklin roosevelt and the american people will be released soon news daily airs on patriot weekdays from to eastern
