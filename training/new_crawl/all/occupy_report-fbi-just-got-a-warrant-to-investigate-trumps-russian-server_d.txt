a new exclusive report from heat streets louise mensch a former british member of parliament claims that the division just obtained a warrant to conduct national security searches of donald trumps recently uncovered private server if true the theory expressed in her report would also plausibly explain why the new york times shot down not one or two but a trio of mainstream news stories last week which pointed to fbi surveillance of donald trumps ties to russia and her report fits a fourth published report about western european intelligence activity by newsweek it must be stressed that heat streets report is not confirmed fact and if its report and theory is proven true it does not point to use of the warrant for a criminal arrest of donald trump at this time either a secret warrant authorizes covert electronic intelligence gathering of a us person by the fbi and it is issued by a secret panel of federal judges in washington without participation of the target being in the hearing louise exclusive report contains a series of logical and plausible theories which must be viewed skeptically until the first sentence is proven to be true two separate sources with links to the community have confirmed to heat street that the fbi sought and was granted a court warrant in october giving permission to examine the activities of persons in donald trumps campaign with ties to russia contrary to earlier reporting in the new york times which cited fbi sources as saying that the agency did not believe that the private server in donald trumps trump tower which was connected to a russian bank had any nefarious purpose the arm sources say an earlier court request around possible financial and banking offenses related to the server the first request which sources say named trump was denied back in june but the second was drawn more narrowly and was granted in october after evidence was presented of a server possibly related to the trump campaign and its alleged links to two banks bank and alfa bank while the times story speaks of sources suggest that a warrant was granted to look at the full content of and other related documents that may concern us persons the fbi agents who talked to the new york times and the stories of slate franklin and mother jones corn may not have known about the warrant sources say because the and criminal sides of the fbi often work independently of each other employing the principle of it cannot be stressed enough that the bombshell first sentence of the heat street report is unconfirmed and not known to be fully factual at this time it also presents a plausible theory why one wing of the fbi might not know what the other is doing which accounts for the new york times shooting down three other published reports but does not prove the times wrong yet the british news report does fit the bigger picture of confirmed news coverage of trumps russian ties and does present a plausible theory based upon these four reports from reputable mainstream media news outlets again it cannot be stressed enough that this is a difficult to confirm the essential facts of this report of the fbi donald trumps server the corroborating news reports both provide a plausible theory to mensch but also should cause the reader to draw conclusions skeptically because heat streets report could fit the publicly known facts all too well but still be factually false a shrewdly concocted story based solely upon known news reports and using the secretive nature of the warrant process and the court could be used to intentionally broadcast an entirely false story as well and one with factual underpinnings its nearly impossible to obtain a copy of any warrant and the emergence of one of these top secret documents happens with the same rarity and danger to the source which edward experienced when leaking documents about government secrecy and surveillance the british heat street is a conservative news outlet actually owned by news corporation and politically speaking it despises louise mensch herself was part of republicans for at one time before endorsing agent who is running a campaign in utah theres no explicit partisan reason for mensch or especially her publisher to favor the democratic nominee based on the reports in their its also notable that mensch was a republican for before endorsing that make her much different than any member of the news media registered as a republican like the boards of numerous conservative newspapers in america who endorsed based on the facts available readers should also take into account personal history of histrionic statements trolling and reported substance issues which may make her an unreliable news source when evaluating the source of this report to decide if its plausible although none of that takes away from the sound logic of the big picture of her claims in the heat street report if its a lie or misinformation certainly every piece of the puzzle is confirmed elsewhere or fits known facts except for one the heat streets report does assert one new yet unknown and unproven claim as fact about which is the majority russian energy company that ran in between stints as president there is no other report to date which links former trump campaign chairman paul to so its actually either an exclusive detail by mensch which is entirely unconfirmed or its wrong former trump campaign manager paul is known to have known ties to ukrainian political parties and the fbi leaked that he is being investigated to just last week ukrainian clients allegedly paid him million off the books and are a party whose last president defected to russia after a popular uprising ironically trumps fellow republican senator rand paul filibustered the old patriot act leading to the even more ironically named usa freedom act which in theory promotes more transparency about the secretive warrants but which actually gives the power of disclosure to the executive branch of government and not the judges the next president would have political reasons both to release the warrant record and also to withhold it for very the same reasons that democrats decried the numerous disclosures of the investigation in october however unlike the fbi directors breach of advice and policy from the attorney general which allegedly violated the hatch act congress gave the warrant disclosure privileges explicitly to the president and after an election it disclosure would not have the same partisan impact of the directors untimely disclosure to recap there is one and only one conservative news outlet reporting that the fbi used a secret national security warrant to conduct surveillance of donald trump news corp owns the reporting the story and theres no further confirmation of the basic facts of the story which presents a plausible theory which must be skeptically viewed for now
