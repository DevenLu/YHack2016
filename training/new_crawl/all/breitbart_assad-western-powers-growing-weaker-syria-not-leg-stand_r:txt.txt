the sunday times of london scored an interview with syrian dictator over the weekend and found him utterly devoid of regret for his brutal actions in the syrian civil war which has killed some syrians and driven millions more out of the country in fact at one point in the interview literally shrugged off the body count then laughed and assured the interviewer he has no problem sleeping at night its the fault of terrorists and we are talking about war not charity in war you always have innocents hurt or killed what do you do you do your best terrorists are still in and use civilians as human shields he said we cant just stand still and say destroy the city more important than the city are the people so we have to do the best for them he continued the residents of if polled on the matter would probably insist doing the best for them involves not destroying them even as a russian aircraft carrier moved into position for what the sunday times anticipated would be a terrifying final onslaught on the besieged eastern half of was still blaming everything on the rebels and the western powers that support them while presenting himself as the only alternative to extremist announced were ready for reconciliation with all those who put down arms opened humanitarian corridors for people to leave but the terrorists shoot them is an issue where terrorists have occupied part of the city and we need to get rid of them he said of the devastated city complained that of him has reached its peak this is a dictator this is killing his people dropping barrel theres nothing more they can say about me he complained neatly eliding the question of whether he is dropping barrel bombs on civilians during the course of the interview he flatly denied using chemical weapons and claimed rebel fighters were using doctored photos to accuse him of such crimes against humanity in the past if said anything people would say the syrian president is disconnected from reality now its different the west is becoming much weaker they have a leg to stand on explaining to people whats going on crowed isis was smuggling oil and using iraqi under american satellites and drones to make money and the west was not saying anything whereas here the russians interfered and isis started to shrink in every sense of the word he added he claimed no one has proposed anything in the way of a political solution to the syrian crisis which would come as news to all the american european and middle eastern diplomats who have been scrambling to cobble such a solution together even friends in iran called for a political solution on tuesday of course what really means is that no one except his patrons in russia and iran has proposed a political solution that would give him complete victory leaving him in power indefinitely he tipped his hand by saying to talk about a political solution while the other side is controlled by masters in saudi turkey usa and france is not realistic the core of the problem is those countries are interfering if they stop then the terrorists will be weak and leave or be defeated and then we can sit as syrians and talk about solutions even sneered at the white helmets an internationally lauded nobel peace group of rescuers who have suffered significant casualties as they worked to save civilians caught in the these angels wearing these white helmets are the same people celebrating over the dead bodies of syrian soldiers they are militants who are suddenly changing their packaging charged he was confident of his strength in syria after a year of russian and iranian assistance claiming that former opponents of his regime are coming back into the fold because under the control of militants they have no judges no local administration no one collects garbage no one takes care of you medically credits russian assistance for turning the tide against what he portrayed as an international conspiracy between western powers and terrorists to overthrow his regime we call it a world war but its a world war against syria tens of countries against us sending those terrorists money and logistics whereas our army is only syrian so we struggled he said at the end we were fighting an unlimited reserve of terrorists coming to syria and we struggled so russian firepower and iranian support has compensated he is not as isolated as he used to be not only does have help from russia and iran but he just dispatched an envoy to congratulate the new president of lebanon who took office after unsuccessful attempts to install a president over the past two years is allied with and supports the envoys visit will be the first since the syrian civil war broke out in
