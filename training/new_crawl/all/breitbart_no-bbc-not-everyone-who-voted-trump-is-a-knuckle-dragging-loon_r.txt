like the rest of the liberal media the has been having a bit of a crisis over donald trumps victory the helpless ranting rage stage of its grief is yet to come at the moment its still going through the flailing disbelief phase as discovered when appeared on the radio media show ostensibly id been invited on to offer my views on how the mainstream media had managed to call the election so badly wrong if a reader the answer has long been obvious because theres a vast constituency of people out there who feel remotely represented by the with its smug metropolitan bias but get the impression that my interviewer was much interested in my opinions what he wanted to do was demonstrate to listeners that was some kind of rabid loon whose deranged they could safely ignore this became obvious when he asked me whether or not believed that president had been born in the usa was so taken aback by the naked absurdity of this leading question that thought he was joking at first the interviewers name was paddy and whenever heard him on radio always found him to be a pretty agreeable sort of cove nicely spoken privately educated not obviously a rampant foaming yet here he was not so subtly implying that was one of those loony conspiracy theorists a who believes that born in the usa and therefore was never eligible to be president well yeah said evenly mean personally seen his birth certificate like to think it would have been pretty obvious to any sane person listening that was joshing paddy slightly here mean it would be one thing if id ever written articles making such a claim but is really quite an extreme and loopy position not a mainstream one even among surely thought this respectable interviewer cant be trying to smear me quite so blatantly but yes he was right so not sure whether or not was born in america said triumphantly as though just successfully lured me into the most incredible trap perfectly happy with the way the rest of the show went got my points across well enough and think in the end many listeners will have been taken in by bizarre and blatant what fascinated me though was that even on a harmless afternoon radio programme about the media the bias could be quite so shameless theres a school of thought that says the and its liberal are so intellectually corrupt we even engage with them totally respect this fuck approach as advocated by the likes of vox day and mike but its just not for me english and much as aware of its glaring faults the is part of my culture sure one can rail against it but its not about to go away any time soon and because of its on broadcasting in britain it remains a vital way of reaching the widest possible audience ducking out of its programmes just because a bunch of lefty trying to shaft you at every turn is not only cowardly but it does a disservice to all those listeners quite like to hear an alternative viewpoint now and again to leaven the relentless pc worthiness also buy the argument that one should be combative all the time love the video of destroying that reporter and ill happily engage in this sort of thing myself as did when had a go at brown but if always on the offensive always irritably calling the out on their devious ways you run the risk of coming across like a peevish crosspatch sometimes think its better to let them hang themselves with their own rope and just be amused and whatever rather than obviously pissed off but the broader significance of my experience on the media show is this just because our side has won first with now with trump mean its about to get any easier on the contrary the frustrated are going to be feeling extremely bitter and vengeful and are going to do everything in their power to blacken the reputations and twist the motives of people who voted and people who voted donald trump as vox day notes here the liberal media is already trying to reclaim the narrative in its selective coverage of protests so the and the rest never will discover the answer to why it is they got this presidential election so badly wrong because they want to listen and even if they did it would make no sense to them in the of the as in the minds of all media the reason trump won and the reason britain voted is that morons who should never have been let anywhere near a polling station somehow escaped from the madhouse and went and ruined everything perhaps one of those bad bad people yourself hope you feel very ashamed
