dear liberals who are trying to dismiss the riots as an understandable expression of universal human nature no its not universal its just you there is no equivalent urge to political violence on the right lets get the nomenclature out of the way right up front not trump riots riots and could shut a great deal of the violence down by speaking out against it with passion and without qualifications neither of them has done so as of friday the media could help by demanding and speak up but they could punish both of them for indulging the rioters by staging special reports with dramatic music america under siege day and hounding every democrat official who passes before their cameras you know damn well they would do both of those things if these were trump supporters misbehaving or even peaceably demonstrating after a victory you also know there would be no significant effort to understand the rioters and their grievances if they were people of the right celebrities would not be playing along by sharing their own feelings of frustrated rage major media outlets would not be pretending the riots were merely protests or demonstrations until the local police pointed at the burning wreckage and told them to knock it off no in that mirror universe where won the election there would be absolutely zero tolerance for anyone who refused to instantly and completely accept the legitimacy of her election everything donald trump ever said about rigged elections and voter fraud would be playing on an endless loop those injured or vandalized by violent street theater would become national celebrities but we know none of that would actually happen in the mirror universe because the american right hold violent demonstrations much less outright riots we know what demonstrations look like in modern america tea party rallies that clean up their own garbage haunted by a few creepy democrat activists trying to stage incidents of violence or racism the media has been resolutely ignoring titanic march for life rallies in washington for decades they get away with it because the are resolutely own political violence for a number of reasons one of the big ones is that media excuses it and indulges democratic political leaders who excuse it the odious senator harry for example is currently trying to pin the riots on trump a sexual predator who lost the popular vote and fueled his campaign with bigotry and hate while arguing that the fears of liberals is entirely rational because donald trump has talked openly about doing terrible things to them this would not be tolerated for one single second by the media class if a republican said it to excuse riots against the election of president would be chased off the national stage by a horde of shrieking reporters and since the retiring former majority leader of the senate his entire party would be forced to renounce him in a series of inquisitions another reason is that liberals seek total personal and spiritual fulfillment in politics it is for all intents and purposes their religion they think political positions are the only meaningful measure of personal character who cares if you drowned a girl in your car and spent your life perpetrating one documented instance of degrading lechery after another if you were good on issues so what if you abused an intern for sex and assaulted a few women if you did your bit to keep the abortion mills churning no big deal if you cruise out of office with americans shedding blood on battlefields across the middle east as long as you came into office really hating that warmongering cowboy bush the unseemly emotional meltdowns so many liberals are proudly posting after the election may of them using their own children as props testify to how deeply liberals confuse personal identity with political posturing they also believe in passion as a political force which is one reason they work so hard to strip their political opponents of passionate arguments everything people who liberals get excited about is as racism sexism xenophobia nationalism you know the devil words the left is lashing out today because it just cant understand how trump could win when they hate him so much they think the intensity of their opposition should give them some kind of election the left has taken steps to render its followers childlike and children only have two modes of expression begging and screaming once upon a time we thought universities were supposed to produce adults but now they produce children children accustomed to getting their way with campus protests tom at media chronicled some of the worst idiocies of the week a yale professor allowed students to skip their midterm exams to deal with election grief the university of kansas trotted out therapy dogs cornell held a the university of michigan gave the students and coloring books to work out their trump grief these children emerge into the adult world thinking speech codes trigger words and safe spaces still count for something in other words they think collectivist power is what matters not individual achievement and responsibility these spontaneous riots the left has machinery in place to produce street theater money changed hands to organize these teachers are indulging sanctioning or even leading protests complete with profane chants only the left can abuse public education this way because owned it for decades the right has no equivalent system for churning out instant protest marches especially involving other peoples children the violent rioters are emboldened by the narrative of unrest they see themselves as the tip of the spear one last thing to remember about political violence the audience for such theater is primarily too the people who finance and organize these ugly demonstrations necessarily think they can intimidate normal americans into satisfying their desires the most horrendous demonstrations are held in cities ruled by democrats for generations after all those watching from afar are mostly grinding their teeth and thinking their decision to vote for the guy in looks pretty good right now no the intended audience is the left and its organs the mainstream media and the administrative state these demonstrations are meant to build liberal unity and give the organizers leverage with civic institutions the targets of intimidation are people wavering in their devotion to the democrat party the masterminds behind the riots of the last few days are keenly aware that donald trump flipped blue states and did very well with solidly democratic constituencies a little fire and broken glass might help those folks remember who supposed to vote for next time sure there would have been some very upset people out there if had won particularly if they thought vote fraud was involved some of them would have said very harsh things but cities paralyzed by violent demonstrations and mobs confronting riot police for a good long while now liberals thats all been you in fairly rapid succession we had occupy wall street black lives matter and now this maybe its time for you to think about why your ideology is so prone to violence
