not everyone that voted for trump is a sexist or a racist he rails how many times does the vote not have to go our way before we realize that our argument won by hurling labels and insults the left is responsible for this result because the left have now decided that any other opinion any other way of looking at the world is unacceptable we debate anymore because the left won the cultural wars so if on the right a freak evil racist stupid you are a basket of how do you think people are going to vote if you talk to them like that when has anyone ever been persuaded by being insulted or labeled so now if you are on the right or even against the prevailing view you are attacked for raising your opinion thats why people wait until in the voting booth no ones watching any more theres no blame or shame or anything and you can finally say what you really think and that is a powerful thing the tories in charge and now trump and all the polls were wrong all of them because when asked people cant admit what they think they cant admit what they think not allowed to the left allow them to we have made people unable to articulate their position for fear of being shut down embarrassed to say it every time someone on the left has said you say that they are contributing to this culture its time to stop moaning its time to stop crying over spilt fucking it time to stop ignoring your opponents or worst trying to silence them its time to stop banning people from speaking in universities its time to stop thinking that an article on your feed is political engagement that banning a gymnast from doing what good at because he insulted religion somehow achieves something and sorry when did the gymnasts association start thinking it was appropriate to start enforcing blasphemy laws its time to realize that reading the guardian make you a liberal that green peace lower your carbon footprint and if my is triggering you you can either fuck off to your safe space or you can engage and debate me and tell me what getting wrong because trump just won the white house being offended work any more throwing insults work any more the only thing that works is fucking bothering doing something and all you have to do is engage in the debate talk to people who think differently to you and persuade them of your argument its so easy and the left have lost the art stop thinking that everyone who disagrees with you is evil or racist or sexist or stupid and talk to them persuade them otherwise because if you ill tell you what you get you get president donald trump
