this mornings key headlines from donald trump victory signals a major increase in nationalism supporters and opponents of donald trump outside trump tower in manhattan on wednesday globe two weeks ago wrote media storm shows sudden change in public mood after fbi director james made a friday afternoon announcement that he might the case friday afternoon announcements including many previous announcements about and dumps are almost always immediately forgotten but this one created a media storm in the mainstream media indicating a sudden change in public mood as wrote at the time from the point of view of generational dynamics the media storm was much more important than whether was guilty or innocent because it indicated that the public mood was changing and that media storm was a harbinger of the trump victory which was a surprise to almost every media source and almost every polling organization now donald trump has to govern he is very similar to in that neither has the vaguest clue what is going on in the world and after eight years in office seems to know as little today about what is going on in the world as he did eight years ago it remains to be seen whether donald trump will be any better at learning what is going on in the world than boomers are generally less arrogant and more willing to listen to reason than so there is hope one thing that his staff might do is develop some expertise in generational theory generational dynamics is a methodology that does analyses using system dynamics applied to changes in generations since the web site contains thousands of articles with hundreds of predictions all of which have turned out to be right there is no web site analyst politician or journalist with a success record in correct analyses and forecasts that comes even close to the generational dynamics success if the staff of donald trump or any other politician in the country or the world wants to base policy on whats actually going on in the world rather than on fatuous or ideologies that are almost always wrong then they should develop an understanding of generational theory and read the daily world view articles related articles referendum and us election illustrate dangers of predicting elections as been writing for years starting long before the current election this is a generational crisis era and as in other crisis eras nationalism racism and xenophobia have been increasing in countries around the world this trend illustrates why pollsters have been so wrong in both the referendum and the us elections pollsters were using models that date back to the a generational unraveling era when the silent generation was still in charge and knew the enormous dangers of nationalism racism and xenophobia from having survived world war ii polling organizations using models simply did not see the change in attitudes caused by the disappearance of the generations of survivors of world war ii during the campaign was asked several times whether generational dynamics could predict the result of the election the easy answer is that chaos theory proves that election results cannot be predicted and any polling organization would agree for those who would like some additional technical details about this use a fairly simple test to determine whether or not something can be predicted when want to decide whether something can or cannot be predicted use what call the butterfly test you may have heard about the finding from chaos theory that a butterfly flapping its wings in china could start a chain reaction that might might not cause a hurricane in north america thats one reason why it is mathematically impossible to accurately predict the weather more than about two weeks in advance no matter how advanced weather science becomes whether forecasting will never be any better than it is now so build on that concept a butterfly flapping its wings in china could cause a hurricane in north america and that could cause people to stay home changing the outcome of an election since something as tiny as a butterfly flapping its wings could change the outcome of an election theres no hope of predicting the outcome of an election or if you use polls to predict the results of an election you likely have no better than a or chance of getting it right what generational theory does do is predict broad trends involving entire populations or entire generations these trends cant be affected by a butterfly flapping its wings because there are too many people involved people have free will so you cant predict the actions of an individual or a small group of people but you can predict many things about an entire population or an entire generation the honeymoon calm before the storm almost everyone know hated this presidential campaign as the two candidates at times seemed to be in a race to be more sickening and disgusting than the other how low could the country go pollster frank appearing on minutes last sunday has been conducting political focus groups for years and he traces the growth in political vitriol as starting in the presidential election when al gore won the popular vote but george bush became president after six weeks and a supreme court decision according to and in that six weeks we came from being democrats and republicans to being outraged to believing that the other side is trying to steal the election and when the election was over there was no coming together there was no honeymoon and from that point on the goal has been to not to respect and at least to listen to but to the opposition and now today in hours from now it will be tens of millions of people who will believe that the loser should have won that the election was rigged and that the winner is illegitimate feel like a child of a divorce these two candidates the way they fight the way they yell at each other the way they make it personal its like having your parents get divorced and you want to live with either of them and the judge sits there and says pick one or the other and you say how about the jury can can go there its awful suggested that the social media is at fault there were people in that focus group who used language that if my mom was still alive and said it she would literally cut me out of the will theres no so we now say exactly what we feel and goddamn it listen to me and thats really what it is right now listen to me not learn from you listen to me many people are hoping that the vitriolic attacks will end now that the election is over and that things can return to normal and when they say normal they mean the a generational unraveling era thats not going to happen the generational crisis era turning officially began in years after the end of world war ii as the last of the silent generation retired the vitriolic attacks on george bush had begun a couple of years earlier as described but only become worse since then and gone in both directions between republicans and democrats titled this article the honeymoon calm before the storm as kind of a joke new presidents are supposed to have a honeymoon that lasts days or so into his new administration but that was before the rise of trump will be lucky if his honeymoon lasts the rest of this month this kind of chaotic storm always happens during a generational crisis era in the president franklin roosevelt was deeply hated for many of his decisions one of the worst was his decision to try to pack the supreme court by expanding it judges in order to get the court to stop declaring his favorite new laws unconstitutional and you can imagine how vitriolic the attacks must have become when roosevelt became the first us president to run for a third term the previous generational crisis era saw the election in of abraham lincoln as president this infuriated the southern states and led to the civil war many people are describing whats happening today as unique in american history thats far from true whats happening today happens in every country in every generational crisis era minutes and related articles hypothesis is this the apocalypse heard several journalists on the and on wednesday talk about the end of the world the apocalypse there were several reasons why the world was going to end one was because trump was going to end climate change talks and were all going to freeze to mean burn to death and the other was because trump was going to start a nuclear war and start dropping nuclear bombs on everyone nobody mentioned the apocalypse caused by an attack by china this talk of apocalypse is silly but it is also not far from the truth president term led to world war ii and president term led to the civil war thats what happens during a generational crisis era no matter president as been writing for years the world is headed for a new world war the clash of civilizations world war the allies of the west will include japan india russia and iran the enemies will be china pakistan and the muslim countries this will be the greatest war in history by the time its over every nuclear weapon in the world will have been used on someone estimate that the total deaths from nuclear war ground war famine and disease to be around billion people leaving around billion people to rebuild the world and heres another little bit of irony assuming that this war begins during donald trumps term in office and assuming that the united states survives the war then trump will become a national hero with the stature of roosevelt and lincoln keys generational dynamics donald trump james chaos theory butterfly test frank minutes fourth turning franklin roosevelt abraham lincoln permanent web link to this article receive daily world
