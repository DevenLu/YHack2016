during the election both candidates promised to bring manufacturing back to the the rhetoric reports us news has struck home with americans across the those currently or formerly employed in the embattled and manufacturing sectors who have repeatedly borne the brunt of corporate efforts to move work overseas harry founder and president of the initiative which aims to bring manufacturing back home is optimistic he told me that we are now losing about as many jobs to as we are recovering gone from losing somewhere around manufacturing jobs a year in to to net breaking even he explained balancing the trade deficit will increase manufacturing by about four million jobs at current levels of productivity according to the percentage of people who work in manufacturing is at a record low of compares to in in and a record during world war two while there are many factors driving lower wages give countries like china and mexico a competitive advantage energy costs however give the an advantage as manufacturers need a lot of energy to make their processes work stated gary director of sales for new jerseys gas he says a typical office building will use therms a year a good sized manufacturing plant will probably use that same amount in just a couple of days electricity frequently represents one of the top operating costs for energy intensive industries such as plastics metals chemicals and according to a recent study comparing costs in the and china electricity is about percent higher in china because manufacturing is energy intensive bringing industry back to the will increase our energy consumption president has derided energy use the uses far more electricity than its north american neighbors combined but the also does more with our energy comparing the gross domestic product and energy consumption numbers for the and canada for example both use a similar volume of energy but the has substantially higher a study of global energy consumption versus found energy is so intrinsically linked to that energy policy more or less dictates how our economy performs mike the author explains that rising is an indication of a prosperous is why economic commentators cite numbers when they say president may become the first president since herbert hoover not to serve during a year in which the growth in real was at least percent yet in the name of climate change through government policy many countries are trying to discourage energy use by forcing costs up states they are cutting energy use as the economy of europe collapses because european industry can no longer compete with countries where energy prices are not artificially raised by senseless green policies the energy advantage is not just an issue between countries it is a factor in where companies locate within the high electricity bills are a strong to create new jobs associated with a new or expanded product line writes don welch president of new hampshire based globe manufacturing co new electric prices are percent higher than the national average company is the leading producer of turnout gear welch explains higher electricity costs not only add hundreds of thousands of dollars to the cost of making our suits and its money we could otherwise in the business including creating new jobs here in new hampshire new high electricity prices are a drag on our economy it puts new hampshire companies like mine at a competitive disadvantage compared to companies in other parts of the country because globe also has plants in three different states he clearly sees the difference energy costs make in doing business welch says already know that the electric bill am paying at my facility in oklahoma is half of what pay in new hampshire if he is going to add a product line energy costs are a big factor in deciding where to expand if we can bring back manufacturing at least stem the flow of them from our need to be encouraging energy and making more of it available believes balancing the trade deficit should be the number national priority he told me that would take a percent increase in would require about a percent increase in energy usage yet climate change policies demand that we take greater cuts than the developing countries like china and india if our energy costs continue to go up as they have in new hampshire well lose the best competitive advantage we have explains manufacturing has the highest multiplier effect among the major sectors every job created in manufacturing creates additional jobs in other sectors that supply support and service manufacturers to bring manufacturing back to the or encourage expansion we need energy that is abundant available and well need to use more not less if we want to balance our trade deficit boost and have a prosperous economy energy is the key as am known for saying energy makes america great the author of energy freedom noon serves as the executive director for energy makes
