the motto of the united states is pluribus unum out of many one that unity has been elusive for the past few days as liberal america struggles to absorb the shock of donald trumps astonishing victory in the presidential election if trump had lost conservatives would have been the ones struggling to cope although we would have had an easier time of it we did not expect to win and up until trump took the lead in florida the scene at the midtown was more of a wake than a party among liberal friends and relatives have seen two reactions some have simply lashed out even publicly those reactions are worth ignoring for now because they reflect a raw emotional state of anger and distress that is not amenable to argument others have approached me quietly seeking reassurance that trump is not the ogre they have been led to believe he is or just trying to understand how rational people could have voted for him so they can process what happened that is constructive there are lots of reasons that smart people voted for trump but reason really suffice to communicate the point the truth is that there are reasonable people on both sides of the political divide they come to different conclusions because they start with different assumptions about reality even if the journey from assumption to conclusion uses the same kind of logical reasoning on both sides so the question then becomes where our assumptions come from and why they are so different the most important assumptions we make are about america itself the default belief of the american conservative is that america is basically good liberals do not share this view or think they do not in their minds america is capable of being good but requires what called fundamental transformation america is not good and started out rather badly that is not a belief that comes naturally to most people it has to be taught and in fact is taught sadly in our schools when donald trump ran on the slogan make america great again he rallied those who did not like the shocks of recent years globalization illegal immigration it was not difficult for trumps opponents to project or to tell others that what he really rejected were the positive changes that had brought america into closer harmony with its founding ideals like civil rights and gender equality and religious tolerance trumps rhetoric made his vision easier to distort and so the divide is partly about trump but really about deeper differences luckily they are not irreconcilable there are moments in american history when the conservative and liberal impulses to preserve and to change were able to meet those moments were always mediated through faith we forget too easily that when martin luther king sought to change american laws he appealed to white americans through a common belief in god and humans as gods children we have largely neglected the power of faith in recent years at the funeral for the slain dallas police officers last summer president borrowed kings phrase see whats possible when we recognize that we are one american family all deserving of equal treatment all deserving of equal respect all children of god thats the america that know but then he moved on tragically given the opportunity he was wasting to his political priorities renewing the division god remains crucial to our national survival you may not believe in god and religion may play no role in your everyday life whatsoever but it remains true that faith shaped the idea that each individual has dignity and inalienable rights and that we are all created equal as abstract philosophical postulates those ideas had existed since antiquity but they could never be put into practice without the uniquely american faith that such rights were beyond and prior to the power of the state that was something the rebbe mendel understood on the saturday night before the election trump and her husband visited the rebbes grave his in queens their visit was more than just a way to ensure good luck on election day it was an affirmation of the rebbes understanding of americas role in the world which is so well described by joseph in the book rebbe the life and teachings of mendel the most influential rabbi in modern history writes about why the rebbe saw america as special a nation of high ideals the rebbe routinely referred to the united states as a government of kindness he saw america as perhaps the first society in which there was a hope of carrying out universal mission not to make the whole world jewish but to bring the world starting with the united states to a full awareness of one god who demands of human beings moral behavior at a meeting with mayor david during the crown heights riots of the rebbe expressed the hope that the mayor would be able to bring peace to the city to both sides responded the rebbe replied we are not two sides we are one side we are one people living under one administration and under one god may god protect the police and all the people of the city for the rebbe and he emphasized this on different occasions from many one and in god we trust were the bedrock of the united states power and in his stump speech on the campaign trail donald trump had expressed strikingly similar sentiments in the last days before the election first noticed it on monday in his speech in north carolina when he closed by saying were fighting to bring us all together just imagine if we started working together under one god saluting one american flag when he said those words which the crowd cheered loudly donald trump was doing more than pandering to a socially conservative audience he was connecting to americas idealism at the most fundamental level slogan stronger together also contained an appeal to national unity but it was an insincere appeal because made clear that you were not part of the together if you held certain views was why her speech the century philosopher john whose ideas shaped those of the founders argued that people had the right to rebel against their government when it had been fundamentally changed against their will one type of change was when such a single person or prince sets up his own arbitrary will in place of the laws which are the will of the society declared by the legislative in that grim circumstance where public trust had been destroyed the appeal then lies nowhere but to heaven the trump movement was a peaceful rebellion against the betrayal of trust and it was for many an appeal to heaven one woman at a florida rally on monday carrying a sign that said god have mercy on america told me only god could really make america great again but trump would do for now as a way to start now after the election faith in god is even more important faith contains gratitude for what we are and hope for what we could be it can bridge the divide let us seek him is senior at news his new book see no evil hard truths the left cant handle is available from
