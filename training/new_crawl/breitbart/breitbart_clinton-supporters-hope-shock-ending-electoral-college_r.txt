the requirement here is modest a small group of republican electors must be persuaded to vote their conscience no question that many of these are appalled at the prospect of a trump presidency surely a few are courageous enough to cast a vote for someone else if not all would vote for another republican of course it seem likely that many would choose depending upon how current recounts turn out somewhere between a minimum of ten and a maximum of electors would have to defect in order to bring trumps count down to less than if neither party ends up with votes then the decision passes to the house of representatives and a vote in that chamber determines the winner the house is permitted to choose from among the three candidates who receive the most votes in the electoral college hence dissenting electors can rest assured that they and the voters they represent will end up with a republican president this is of course presented as a bipartisan initiative that responsible republicans should join as well as bitter emotionally unstable democrats it is noted that electors cast their ballots anonymously which shields individuals from retribution confusingly for members of which suddenly seem all that interested in moving on the group is circulating a petition to muscle faithless electors into turning against trump as well as a petition to abolish the electoral college altogether its beyond hilarious to read against the evils of direct democracy coming from the party that was just two years ago telling us the midterm elections were meaningless because president should be an absolute dictator certified by democratic vote and maybe it was time to do away with midterm elections or possibly even congress himself announced that not only was direct democracy as long as it empowered him but he even need to see the ballots because he can read the minds of people who vote and would defy the authority of congress on their behalf is this scenario even possible well as everyone pushing it notes states actually require their electors to vote for the pledged candidate and the others mostly have laws that punish faithless electors rather than preventing them from changing their votes michigan and minnesota are the only states that automatically nullify the votes of renegade electors and there is some debate in legal circles over whether any of the punitive laws could actually be enforced the new york times reviewed the history of the electoral college on election day and noted that while there have been examples of faithless electors most of them are from long ago and never affected the final result of a presidential election the times quoted the federal archives declaration that throughout our history as a nation more than percent of electors have voted as pledged the last example of a faithless elector was an unknown soul from minnesota who voted for john edwards instead of john kerry in which exactly cover the faithless electorate in glory more recently the election produced two threats of faithless electoral college from two washington state democrats who said they vote for if she won the general election one of them flatly refused to vote for her the other refused to commit to voting for her the one who said no no no on absolutely not no way was an american indian robert he said he was hoping the election would come down to a swing vote and give him the chance to personally torpedo her candidacy cold water was showered upon the electoral college revolt friday from the surprising dark cloud of vox which declared that realistically considering how big a lead trump has who the electors are how their votes are counted and hundreds of years of american democratic norms its a silly fantasy that is just in no way shape or form going to happen vox hits on the most important reasons why including the sheer magnitude of the task awaiting those who think they can bully enough republican electors they tend to be stalwart party men and women into switching their vote and the severe unlikelihood of the republican house deciding to unleash nationwide chaos and armageddon by throwing the election to someone other than trump the post sneers that trump supporters will scream there will likely be violence and perhaps riots if the electoral college overturns the election a window kids got that from supporters right theres nothing desirable about unleashing the kind of uncertainty that an shock ending to the election would create especially since faith in our government institutions is already at low tide plenty of people who big fans of donald trump would be outraged by a maneuver that disenfranchised millions of voters and threw the election to someone who even on the ballot liberals supposed to be deeply deeply concerned about disenfranchisement no fans only courting heartache by dreaming of a miraculous electoral college revolt better to kick back with few bottles of your favorite adult beverage and denounce the electoral college as a tool of white supremacy and sexism you can rejoin the rest of america in the real world after you sober up
