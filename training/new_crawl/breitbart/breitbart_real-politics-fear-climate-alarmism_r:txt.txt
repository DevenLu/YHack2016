on the eve of the elections a number of pundits and pope to warn americans against an undefined politics of fear while simultaneously spreading the fear of the nebulous enemy of global warming in a speech delivered at the vatican saturday pope francis denounced making political decisions based on fear because fear weakens and us destroys our psychological and spiritual defenses and numbs us to the suffering of others he said no tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears he said meanwhile fantastical reports emerge every day stoking fears of climate change and attributing every possible ill to a supposed evil that none truly understands on the same day of the popes vatican speech the journal business insider ran an ominous scare piece titled foods that could go extinct thanks to climate change which threatened that global warming is endangering some of the most popular and delicious foods on the planet here are seven foods and drinks that could grow more expensive and eventually disappear due to climate change the essay confidently announced avocados coffee beer oysters maple syrup chocolate and lobsters if telling people they will have no more chocolate or beer if they approve climate change agreements constitute the lowest form of it would be tough to find an example that does moreover the article fails to mention that global warming scares are routinely debunked almost as soon as they are propagated to take just one example from the business insider article itself the supposed extinction of coffee in september a report from the nonprofit climate institute concluded that the area around the world fit for coffee production would decrease by due to climate change the essay declared already climate change has made coffee crops more vulnerable to diseases like coffee rust which have wiped out more than a billion dollars in crops it said the problem with these claims they are completely false what the article failed to mention was that just a month after the climate institute story a group of researchers from the university of released a comprehensive study on coffee and climate change asserting that the supposed connection between the worlds coffee supply and climate change was completely baseless although mainstream media reports including newspapers such as the new york times have linked coffee production with climate change the scientists said they found no evidence for this leading them to reject the climate change hypothesis the researchers published their findings in philosophical transactions of the royal society in which they conclude we find no evidence for an overall trend in disease risk in regions of colombia from to therefore while weather conditions were more conducive to disease outbreaks from to we reject the climate change hypothesis so not only does climate change alarmism play into peoples deepest dread of the unknown it also plays fast and loose with the facts if pope francis is correct that fear weakens and us destroys our psychological and spiritual defenses and that no tyranny can be sustained without exploiting our fears citizens would do well to look upon climate change hysteria with a wary and watchful eye
