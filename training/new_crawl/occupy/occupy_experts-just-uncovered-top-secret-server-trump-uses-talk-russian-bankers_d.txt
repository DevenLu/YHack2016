a private group of technical experts has reviewed about the trump organizations usage and just concluded that the republican nominee is using a personal server to surreptitiously communicate from the domain with a controversial bank alfa bank the timing of the russian communications coincides perfectly with milestones throughout the election chart at and the very high level of secrecy deployed to hide them is going to be hard to explain away for the trump campaign adding fuel to the building controversy when researchers contacted alfa bank for comment the trump organization quickly shut down the server the times yet been in touch with the trump spoke with the campaign a week shortly after it reached out to alfa the trump domain name in question seemed to suddenly stop working the computer scientists believe there was one logical conclusion to be drawn the trump organization shut down the server after alfa was told that the times might expose the connection weaver told me the trump domain was very sloppily removed or as another of the researchers put it it looked like the knee was hit in moscow the leg kicked in new york but knowing that all eyes were watching the trump organization casually with alfa bank only four days later on a different server all of this was captured in the domain name system which is the internal directory system leaves log records all over saying how often visits happen and its the very same web services which was attacked last week taking down twitter the new york times and others is the system that routes our requests using names instead of numbers and it keeps logs with address numbers and in this case the practically screams to experts because it shows that there is little other traffic of any other kind by design as we learned from edward the of a situation is incomplete but it can tell you a lot the new domain is owned by one of trumps hospitality marketing contract companies which dispels trumps blown cover story that the private server is just used for marketing domain registration information also confirmed that the same marketing team works on both and the new addresses being used furthermore the technical expert paul revealed that the trump organization went to lengths to shut out all traffic that from alfa bank there is a more sinister reason for creating a private server that only participates in conversation with one specific party was identified by computing legend paul earlier this month the group of computer scientists passed the logs to paul in the world of experts theres no higher authority wrote central strands of the code that makes the work after studying the logs he concluded the parties were communicating in a secretive fashion the operative word is secretive this is more akin to what criminal syndicates do if they are putting together a project put differently the logs suggested that trump and alfa had configured something like a digital hotline connecting the two entities shutting out the rest of the world and designed to obscure its own existence over the summer the scientists observed the communications trail from a distance ironically the academics and others started looking for foreign interference in order to protect both campaigns from outside meddling it appears as if only one of the two campaigns conspired to that end the computer scientists posited a logical hypothesis which they set out to rigorously test if the russians were worming their way into the they might very well be attacking other entities central to the presidential campaign including donald trumps many servers we wanted to help defend both campaigns because we wanted to preserve the integrity of the election says one of the academics who works at a university that asked him not to speak with reporters because of the sensitive nature of his work when researchers contacted alfa bank for comment suddenly the trump organization shut down their domain quickly four days later the trump organization and alfa bank resumed communications and it was the bank who contacted the republican nominees company from moscow somehow knowing the new code to interact with the trump private server this new information shows that after trump asked to hack americas election to prejudice them against democratic candidate in late july traffic between the campaign and the russian bank spiked in the end this is yet another matter that the fbi will surely have to the question is will they be fair and release the files from their inquiry in the kind of act of radical transparency that director james imposed on note above graphic via slate
