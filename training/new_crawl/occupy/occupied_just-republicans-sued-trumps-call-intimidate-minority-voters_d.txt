the democratic national committee just hauled donald trump and the republican national committee into a federal court demanding that they cease the program of minority voter intimidation that trump has inspiring his supporters to carry out the lawyers asked a new jersey federal judge to hold the republican party in contempt for violating a old consent decree to enforce the voting rights act and to issue an injunction to enforce the terms of the agreement which will force republicans to cease their efforts to suppress votes in minority communities during this years general election the lawyers cited donald trumps frequent statements to supporters as well as one of vice presidential nominee mike speeches where he admitted that the was directly coordinating ballot integrity initiatives which are explicitly banned under the agreement trumps overt actions to call his supporters to watch polls in certain areas are a classic attempt to concoct an illegal ballot security program which is why we exclusively predicted this lawsuit could happen three weeks ago last week senator elizabeth warren weighed in with an published in the washington post urging the party to take action this week the democratic coalition against trump also took it upon themselves to lodge a new fbi complaint over trumps voter suppression campaign which violates the same voting rights act provisions covered by this recent action which could land republicans involved in the illegal campaigning like roger stone in criminal court however the democratic action is based on a legal decision so its going to be expedited in court and is likely to yield a rapid order from the federal judge against the republican party and trump heres a summary of what the lawyers filed in federal court today below for complete document defendant republican national committee has violated the final consent by supporting and enabling the efforts of the republican candidate for president donald trump as well as his campaign and advisors to intimidate and discourage minority voters from voting in the presidential election trump has falsely and repeatedly told his supporters that the november election will be rigged based upon fabricated claims of voter fraud in certain areas or certain sections of key states those certain areas are exclusively communities in which large minority voting populations reside notwithstanding that no evidence of such fraud actually exists trump has encouraged his supporters to do whatever it takes to stop got to get everybody to go out and watch and when say watch you know what talking about has been actively organizing election observers to monitor polling stations in certain areas trump has even encouraged his watchers to act like vigilante law enforcement officers although certain officials have attempted to distance themselves from some of the trump campaigns more recent statements there is now ample evidence that trump has enjoyed the direct and tacit support of the in its ballot security endeavors including the collaboration on efforts to prevent this supposed rigging and voter fraud in a rally in denver colorado on august trumps vice presidential running mate indiana governor mike pence admitted that the was directly coordinating with the trump campaign on ballot integrity initiatives stating that the trump campaign and the republican national committee are working very very closely with state governments and secretaries of states all over the country to ensure ballot integrity the support of trumps efforts to recruit watchers who are intended to intimidate voters at their polling places violates this courts consent decree as modified in which explicitly forbid the from engaging in ballot security measures directly indirectly or through its agents or employees the conduct also violates the consent decree under well settled law prohibiting defendants from evading court orders by acting in concert with third parties donald trumps master of dirty tricks roger stone is specifically named in the complaint because is the very same political operative whose minority voter intimidation tactics landed the republican party in hot water for years in the first place for rigging a close new jersey gubernatorial election was won by the candidate stone is currently running a called that is actively signing up trump supporters to volunteer to fight voter fraud is a popular among trump supporters on twitter and stones group maintains an active presence on october stone sent out a deleted message via his twitter feed deliberately designed to mislead democratic voters by secretary likeness and supporters can vote the new way on by to after which voters would apparently receive official confirmation if donald trump does not cease his open calls for voter intimidation the legal action could land him in contempt of court and facing a jail term republicans have spent a massive amount of time and money litigating to escape this consent decree just seven years ago and obtained a new concession to limit its term from infinite which they agreed to in the down to an eight year term which expired next december now that the has taken trump and the republican party back to court its very likely that the terms of the decree will be extended for another eight years through which will take it through the next two presidential election cycles donald trump has wasted the entire last month complaining about a rigged election and encouraging vigilante poll watchers to visit minority neighborhoods now a federal judge will have to step in to keep his campaign from breaking election laws across the country and the republican party will pay the price for his ignorance of election law for years to come
