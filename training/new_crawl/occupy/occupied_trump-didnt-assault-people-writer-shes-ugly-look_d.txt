republican nominee donald trump gave the worst excuse for the allegations of sexual assault he possibly could have by implying that the woman attractive enough for him to have assaulted during an outrageous speech in which he blew dog whistles he took the time to refute the horrendous accusations that people magazine reporter levelled at him last night look at her look at her words you tell me what you think think so said trump in a twisted and petty blow that only trump would sink to the sexual predator not only attempted to discredit her accusations but then shamed her for her looks perpetuating the offensive notion that sexual assault is actually a compliment paid to attractive women as noted by author his remarks spawned the from fusion reporter in which women began tweeting of themselves demanding that yes we look at them and see them as the people they are not as sexual objects for donald trump to and molest so look upon them and read the words of american women being brave enough to invite horrifying harassment from trump trolls by taking a stand against rape culture and its living personification donald trump thats how a sexual predator slips up and admits he checks women out
