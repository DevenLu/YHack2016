in this clip vice president joe calls out donald trump and labels his behavior for what it is sexual assault sat down with to discuss the comments trump made in in which he admits that sexual assault is not just something that he has committed in the past but is his modus operandi when it comes to approaching women first of all what found astounding is that he would so matter who he was talking he would acknowledge that he engaged in the textbook definition of sexual assault mean this is absolutely outrageous behavior spent more of my career trying to figure out how to change the culture in this country so that we treat women with respect and with dignity given that five different women have shared their stories with the world today about being groped or attacked by donald trump after these remarks were filmed its clear that donald trump is a serial sexual predator a history of sex assaults that stretches back decades we must change the culture that surrounds sexuality and consent in this nation the women of america deserve better not because they are our mothers sisters daughters as the sexist republicans use as a justification for revoking support of trump not because they are defined to men by some kind of relationship but by fundamentally recognizing that they are people that deserve the same respect and protection and hold the same rights that white males do once we do that then perhaps men wont be quick to treat women and americans like sexual objects
