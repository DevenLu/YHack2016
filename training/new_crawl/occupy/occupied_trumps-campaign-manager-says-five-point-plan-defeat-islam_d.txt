republican nominee donald trumps third campaign manager just told news on live television a video you can see below that the trump campaign is planning some form of war on islam in the short clip can be seen rattling off the trump campaigns very short list of plans and positions he gave a ten point veterans administration reform plan point plan to defeat islam said rapidly naming her candidates point plan for tax relief yesterday is his plan to as he says drain the swamp said referencing yet another more vague trump plan which apparently her above comments were meant to illuminate which was trending on twitter yesterday the number one trending term on twitter yesterday its unknown at this time if the trump campaign also has a written plan to declare war on islam or if its only discussed in secret but the republican nominee has never shied away from the opportunity to exploit his bases racial fears to dark skinned americans by using the muslim religion as a focal point to encourage open discrimination trump has proposed both an open bias in law enforcement as well as government driven religious tests in this campaign seeking to openly probably illegally discriminate against muslims in america our constitution explicitly recognizes free expression and freedom of religion and the press and to file grievance against the government because european wars tended to start over these matters and our founding fathers explicitly wanted our great nation to avoid the mistakes of history which shed blood tore families and nations asunder and left lasting misery for centuries that is why it is absolutely urgent that democrats work harder than ever over the next days to elect democratic nominee as our first female president otherwise the trump campaigns drain the swamp idea seems poised to cause hell for millions of americans on the basis of racial and religious discrimination and government terror with more context about complaining that the media only wants to cover whats in one tweet her point plan to defeat islam is one of the narratives that she expressly thinks deserves more coverage it was part of a larger eighteen minute segment where spent minutes grilling on her continued denials of donald trumps sex assaults at least she admits that the american election system is not fraudulent and cannot be rigged
