republican nominee donald trumps stubborn refusal to accept the democratic results of this years presidential election has become the major story from tonights third and final debate in vegas fox news anchor did a surprisingly good job moderating the debate and asked what will become the fateful question of unusual election twice will donald trump accept the election results as fair trump replied democratic nominee response was immediate and she spoke for every single american thats horrifying trumps answer is going to loom over the next three weeks until the republican concedes that his campaign has lost this years election its going to even overshadow his boldest lie of the debate claiming tonight that never met when this video clearly shows him bragging about his relationship with the russian dictator america has never had a major party presidential candidate ever who committed to accept the results of a fair election in our country even mitt former campaign manager republican consultant steve said on that refusing to accept the results is nothing less than an attack on a foundational level on the institutions of democracy he hit himself on the head said radio host commenting about trumps stubborn refusal to accept the election results on and knocked himself out contingent talk about results is not within our political norms this is an issue which will not go away and its an entirely strategic disaster by donald trump its not a cliffhanger and its not a comment hell ever be able to walk back as politicians say shamefully trumps refusal to conform to the only foundational part of american politics was the probably his most truthful moment of the night too even his own republican running mate mike pence solidly said before the debate that he would of course accept the results which he surely anticipates will end with democratic nominee earning the historic mantle of becoming americas first female president republican nominee donald trumps politically blasphemous answer to fox news will forever live in infamy god help us all
