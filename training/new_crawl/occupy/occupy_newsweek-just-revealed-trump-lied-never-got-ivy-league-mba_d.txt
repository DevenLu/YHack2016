republican nominee donald trump likes to talk about his collegiate performance how he graduated first in his class from the prestigious ivy league school of business and how his mind is tremendous one of the best minds sorry losers and haters but my is one of the highest you all know it please feel so stupid or not your fault but newsweek reporter noted today that in fact trump never graduated with an masters of business administration from nor was he first in his class he was a transfer student from university and only attended for two years if you inspect the honors list from graduating class trump is nowhere on it it just goes to show that like almost every accomplishment donald trump likes to brag about his academic career is not nearly as respectable as he likes to pretend it is he only got into in the first place because of an interview with a friendly admissions officer who was one of fred trump old high school classmates biographer notes that donald agreed to attend for his fathers sake he showed up for classes and did what was required of him but he was clearly bored and spent a lot of time on outside business activities in her book the trumps said that trumps grades at were just respectable once again trump has been caught in a lie and this is yet another fact that shows he is entirely unqualified to be our president
