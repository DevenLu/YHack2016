in the aftermath of trumps shocking victory russian diplomats are finally admitting the role they played in his campaign while both trump and are still officially denying the contacts between them several moscow diplomats apparently eager to claim credit for their successful interference in the american election have broken their silence yesterday a russian politico confessed that his government was behind the hacks targeting and the and today deputy foreign minister confirmed extensive contacts between the trump campaign and the ruling clique in moscow in an interview with the news agency deputy said that there were contacts with the trump campaign obviously we know most of the people from his entourage said those people have always been in the limelight in the united states and have occupied positions cannot say that all of them but quite a few have been staying in touch with russian representatives statements confirm straight from the horses mouth that trumps campaign has been working in league with a hostile foreign government as his statement suggests trumps entourage has been filled with men with close ties to russia from paul the former campaign manager who served the brutal government of in kiev to carter page the foreign policy advisor and major investor who negotiated with the kremlin a plan to end american sanctions and trump himself who has absolutely gushed praise for the repressive russian dictatorship and who has tight financial ties to the russian oligarchs is no less implicated in this unprecedented foreign interference in an american election given the blind chauvinism of the trump campaign and his supposed love of freedom it is a tremendous irony that he has so thoroughly kowtowed to a ruthless dictator and a prime enemy this treachery would seem to be disqualifying to trumps highly nationalistic fan base but alas we are living in a era in which his supporters can conjure up an imagined war started by to justify trumps subservience to a dictator it is now glaringly apparent to all those willing to look that not only did russia substantially undermine our democracy by meddling in our election but that our is in the words of former cia chief michael useful fool and as our government embraces we abandon the the syrian rebels suffering under russian and bombardment the democratic ukrainian government fighting off a russian invasion that trump denies even exists and the thousands of political dissidents languishing in prisons it is strange that the who most ardently believe america to be a beacon of freedom are the quickest to abandon our commitment to liberty to appease a despot
