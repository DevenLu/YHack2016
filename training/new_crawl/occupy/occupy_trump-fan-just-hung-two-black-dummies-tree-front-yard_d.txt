republicans often talk about yard signs in their neighborhood as proof of their candidates fitness for office but a photograph of one florida residents trump sign with lynched black people hanging from a tree has gone viral its a terrifying reminder of the pervasive racial hatred pitched by donald trumps new republican party which he normalized by accepting the endorsement of former chief david duke and by leading the movement to make america discriminatory again new times reports there needs to be a hell of a lot of hate in your heart to think lynching people on halloween is funny and yet here we are miami a homeowner in three lakes a small community in suburban is celebrating the holiday by lynching two dummies in his or her yard its also impossible to ignore whats just in front of the display on the same lawn a sign the two men are faceless but their skin appears to be dark each wearing traditionally clothing one of the dead men has a sports jersey on and a crooked baseball cap and the other has his pants sagged low black activists have been circulating the photos on all day and calling for a quick response from the neighborhood the property manager tells new times contacted the homeowner and asked him or her to remove the installation after the story went viral the homeowner contacted the local news to pretend that his lynching display was actually some form of tolerance they also claimed that the sign even belong to them but other tipsters made it clear that the entire display clearly depicted a lynching scene with a trump sign trump supporters instantly bombarded the news editors who published the chilling photos its unconscionable that anyone would present a mock lynching in their neighborhood and portray it as anything other than an act of racial hatred shamefully the republican party and their dreadful presidential nominee donald trump have done everything within their power this year to normalize racism and bigotry this is the end result
