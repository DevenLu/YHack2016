author just told canadian tv that he thinks donald trump will be in jail within a year because of his numerous legal entanglements especially those related to the trump university fraud case and his russian ties the new york magazine writer was asked what he thought a trump presidency would be like and this was his response think hell be in jail within a year got the trump university fraud case we probably have criminal charges coming out of his charitable donation florida attorney general got all of the russian ties we know much about got so many legal problems suspect hell spend the next few years huddled with his lawyers how likely is conclusion that trump will be jailed for his crimes to come to pass in the trump university case alone facing civil racketeering charges which are based upon a criminal law designed to let private people litigate to recover money when been defrauded the trump university civil trial begins on november which is incidentally when trump told his supporters to vote a conviction based on the preponderance of the evidence means that a criminal trial is very likely to follow the interviewer was surprised by answer about trumps likely criminal behaviors she followed up by noting that the media discussed those issues about the republican nominees illegal behavior and is instead pursuing account which the fbi used to blatantly interfere in the election this week response was priceless welcome to the great mystery of the america election of right its mystifying to any rational observer why trumps blatantly criminal behavior topic number one for americas media industry which in its rush to vet the two candidates said that the media has spent more time covering than any other single election issue in plainly americas media focused on policy questions outside of use in this years election said that this is a media problem when asked why democratic nominee faces such harsh criticism when shes never been even charged with wrongdoing was quick to point out that most of the negative attacks she face have an easy explanation she is being penalized for having a series of traits that people find unacceptable in a woman he said noting the negative perception of predates her and scandals this goes back two decades now to me the most disturbing lesson about this election is that the united states is a good deal less open to women in positions of power than it would like to pretend that it is meanwhile the republican candidate openly asks russia to hack his enemies and repudiates american intelligence agency findings while being called lawyer for backing the russian dictators foreign policy its impossible to dispute conclusion that americas media has completely missed the most important issues in this years election preferring a detour into instead of looking into actual factual crimes
