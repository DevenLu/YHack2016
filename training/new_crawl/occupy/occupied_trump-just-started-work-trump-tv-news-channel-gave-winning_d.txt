trump is laying his plans behind the scenes and unfortunately it appear that well be rid of him win or lose come november talk of a possible trump tv network has followed the narcissistic real estate mogul throughout his campaign and that may soon become a reality the financial times reports that trumps and husband to trump has informally approached one of the media top about the prospect of setting up a trump television network after the presidential election in november met with from the investment bank to begin exploring options for a possible trump tv channel but no progress has been made since trump has repeatedly denied wanting to delve into the media world but considering that the man lies as easily as he gropes women nothing he says should ever be taken at face value the obstacles facing the establishment of trump tv are significant to say the least according to cable and satellite companies are loath to take on extra channels in an era of shrinking audiences and the cancellation of pricey subscriptions in favour of cheaper alternatives an over the top digital service would be one possibility but still costly because mr trump and mr would need to spend heavily on marketing talent and technology it should also be noted that trump campaign ally roger the diabolical propagandist who ran fox news until he was fired following a wave of sexual abuse allegations is contractually prohibited from joining a trump network as per his severance deal with fox trumps sycophantic lapdogs bill and however are under no such prohibitions could this mean the end of fox news as we know it or is it the beginning of something much worse whatever may happen its clear that actually governing the country is very far down on the list of donald trumps priorities
