the al smith dinner tonight was the last joint campaign event with democratic nominee and her republican opponent its a formal dinner roast held annually since in honor of the first catholic presidential nominee al smith to raise money for charity the event is all about the two candidates making some jokes roasting their opponent and entertaining the crowd at the end of the endlessly long general election campaign donald trump completely missed the memo the republican nominee became the first candidate ever possibly speaker ever booed openly at the al smith dinner just like in a debate trump started off decently and it all went downhill quickly from there as the humorless republican skipped jokes when he opted for naked political attacks reminiscent of the ugly second debate boo birds arrived trump said was so corrupt she got kicked off the watergate commission he said the economy is busted the government is corrupt he said he was she may have only found out about her invitation to the dinner through the wonder of the crowd began to tighten up with some booing audible on the television broadcast trump said is totally different in private than she is in public tonight in public she is pretending not to hate catholics a reference to some campaign staffer discovered through pundits noticed guest of honor cardinal timothy was visibly in agony while trump spoke because of the brutal nature of the republicans low blows now that trumps con has grown old already predicting exactly how the republican is going to spin this latest epic fail by the candidate who did at least manage to make fun of his tiny hands before proving that got a terrible sense of humor or a worse does even exist in real life in fairness trump did have one funny moment tinged in sadness which was when he roasted his own wife over the plagiarized convention speech that consumed his republican convention its the first time where he completely absolved her of blame in public so in that sense it was a relief democratic nominee followed trumps horrid performance by making an actually funny speech that had the crowd into it while making some pundits tongues wag over her pointed political jokes while others rained plaudits on her comfortable demeanor it was pretty easy to pick out funniest line of the night too after listening to your speech she said will also enjoy listening to mike pence deny you ever gave it stayed for minutes after the speeches ended working the room like a trump and his wife departed immediately rather than single out any particular moment heres a video of the entire al smith dinner so you can enjoy entire performance if you need a pick me up it starts at the hour minutes if you looking for a laugh just watch trumps horrid attempt at humor at the hour minutes mark here
