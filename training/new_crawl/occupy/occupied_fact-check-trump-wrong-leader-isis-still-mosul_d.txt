donald trump went on his trademark infantile rant about the stupidity of the american military tonight in response to a question about the offensive of the iraqi army and us special forces against iraqi capital trump complained at length about how we have the element of surprise not understanding that when organizing a multinational offensive involving tens of thousands of soldiers word gets out he also praised the leaders for being smarter than us and for leaving since we told them were coming but according to official and former minister of finance in the iraqi government intelligence indicates that caliph and military commander are still in the perpetual coward trump is incapable of conceiving of a leader who instantly abandon his men to preserve his own skin which is a damning indictment of trump and how he would behave if our nation was in a military crisis furthermore this idea that the united states could somehow sneak attack into an enemy capital is a laughable fantasy out of a bad action movie theres no sneaking up on the other sides capital we sneak up on berlin in world war ii and were not going to do a surprise attack on either says michael knights of the washington institute for near east policy its clear that when it comes to foreign policy and military strategy trump has no idea what the hell talking about and that is a clear and present danger to our national security
