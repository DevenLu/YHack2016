the lengths to which donald trump supporters will go to excuse the overwhelming evidence that he is a sexual predator is simply appalling last night trump spokeswoman dismissed every claim as not credible and blamed the victims for not coming forward sooner notorious liar katrina attempted to say that leeds story credible because armrests were fixed back then to leeds claim that trump lifted the armrest and began groping radio host rush however exposed the crux of the refusal to accept the trump allegations because they reject the notion of consent at all went on his radio show to say that the real problem is leftists complaining about consent in the first place the left will promote and understand and tolerate anything as long as there is one element do you know what it is consent if there is consent on both or all three or all four however many are involved in the sex act its perfectly fine but if the left ever senses and smells that theres no consent in part of the equation then here come the rape police in his mind consent itself is the problem the fact that the left asks for the agreement of both parties to engage in a sexual act is the reason for all this controversy implying that this is somehow a new development that the left is forcing down the throats of americans furthermore mr its not some kind of leftist rape police that you are clearly attempting to create a link from social concerns over your nominees sexual assaults to the imaginary president secret muslim department of emasculated liberals coming to take your freedoms and guns department that your radio show created and blames for a host of different imaginary threats to american sovereignty its the regular police because according to chapter of code sexual acts without the consent of both parties is a crime in the past has complained that consent takes all the romance out of many of you guys in your own experience with women have learned that no means yes if you know how to spot it it used to be used as a cliche he said in his words are laughing in the face of the million american women who have been sexually assaulted since mocking the pain and the trauma that they have endured at the hands of predatory men like donald trump the constant excusing of rape and sexual assault is evidence in and of itself of how rape culture thrives in the united states words are an ideological rejection of the very concept of consent and is one more prong of the conservative rejection of the very idea that women have agency over their own bodies on any level whether its control over their uterus or who they engage with sexually its a denial of the basic humanity of american women and donald trump is the living manifestation of that denial
