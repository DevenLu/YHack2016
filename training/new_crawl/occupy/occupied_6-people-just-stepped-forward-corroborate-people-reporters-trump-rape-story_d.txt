republican nominee donald trumps disgraceful efforts to discredit his sexual assault accusers keeps running into a key obstacle the bravery of those willing to stand up for the truth in the face of a vicious smear campaign and brutal harassment from trumps rabid supporters the story of a people magazine reporter who trump attempted to rape while she was interviewing him for a piece about the happiness of his marriage has now been confirmed by no less than six of her close associates friends and colleagues who all paint the same picture of a devoted young journalist utterly shaken by her abuse at the hands trump her friend marina who has known for more than years says she got a call from her friend the day after the attack was also struggling about not hurting pregnant if the story came out beyond just the attack she was horrified by the vulgar circumstances under which she was attacked and to have an affair she was there in a professional capacity writing an article about their happy marriage and after the incident trump acted like nothing happened was with when they ran into trump on avenue in new york following the assault a meeting denied in yesterdays interview with anderson cooper they chatted in a friendly way who met in college says and what struck me most was that was carrying a child and wearing heels former journalism professor paul who says that the writer called him in tears looking for advice the very night of the harrowing encounter however he cautioned her to remain quiet in fear of how trump may retaliate people east coast editor remembers the day she returned from the assignment in florida to cover trump and his wifes first anniversary she was very upset and told me how he shoved her against a wall the thing remember most was how scared she was felt had to protect her deputy east coast news editor mary green was told story several years later after she returned to the people staff saying was haunted by the assault friend also says she was told the story by has always been a vivacious person who wants to believe in the best of people and this experience definitely messed with that outlook says but she is also a consummate professional she told me that she asked to be taken off the trump beat but she tried her best to move past the experience and continue to do her job well last week recounted how she was at trumps mansion to do a couples interview on the newly married trump and the very pregnant what happened next will make your blood run cold we walked into that room alone and trump shut the door behind us turned around and within seconds he was pushing me against the wall and forcing his tongue down my throat now a tall strapping girl who grew up wrestling two giant brothers even once sparred with mike it takes a lot to push me but trump is much bigger a looming figure and he was fast taking me by surprise and throwing me off balance was stunned and was grateful when trumps longtime butler burst into the room a minute later as tried to unpin myself recounts of her traumatic assault by trump donald trump has been doing his damnedest to smear and discredit his accusers accusing them of lying for personal gain of being in some kind of plot by the machine and encouraging his supporters to harass them to the point where one woman felt forced to flee the country in fear but the evidence just keeps piling up and six different testimonies from six different people close to is about as much evidence as well ever be able to get to corroborate this one story unless the butler who saw the whole thing ever decides to to come clean about his rapist boss but considering at least ten other women have come forward sharing the same kind of story describing behavior that trump himself boasted of doing its pretty clear who the liar is in this situation related items style trump
