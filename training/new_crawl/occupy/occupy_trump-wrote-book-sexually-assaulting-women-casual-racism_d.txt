as it happens republican presidential nominee donald trump has written a book other than the art of the deal and in true fashion it is a fiction novel titled trump should more likely be classified as smut trump described the book as the sexist novel of the decade and was originally billed as the debut novel from new york author international business mogul television and new york city icon donald trump trump tower was a magnificent flop and trump staying true to his penchant for not admitting obvious failure removed his name from the book in its second iteration and gave all credit to ghostwriter robinson however as trump is now to learn once something is on the it is on their forever even if you are a sexually predatory offender with money below is the original listing with the agency in delving into the story which appears to have been written for those with the reading comprehension of a first grader in mind it routinely degrades women the opening chapter speaks of a tenant who is bound and gagged to a bed naked only to be found by one of the towers staff that sounds icily similar to the rape accusations being levied against trump no the official court documents filed against trump state defendant trump tied plaintiff to a bed exposed himself to plaintiff and then proceeded to forcibly rape plaintiff during the course of this savage sexual attack plaintiff loudly pleaded with defendant trump to stop but with no effect defendant trump responded to plaintiffs pleas by violently striking plaintiff in the face with his open hand and screaming that he would do whatever he wanted the other gems of literary genius included take off your sweatshirt he said again her hands were trembling no yes he said take off your sweatshirt she reached for the bottom of her sweatshirt but all she could do was hold onto it no yes cant yes you can do as tell you take off your sweatshirt she tried to swallow but her mouth was totally dry do it take off your sweatshirt do as tell you she closed her eyes hesitated then pulled off her sweatshirt on top of the sordid sexual scenarios in trumps book there are disrespectful racial references apparently trump was too cheap to hire an editor as the book is riddled with grammatical errors such as in fact none of the apartments in the tower was numbered in his quest for attention trump attempted on numerous occasions to have his clap trap babble to television the book had been in the works since the late and according to bob frederick who represents entertainment we hired a writer out of angeles and developed a pilot with and donald was happy with it more than a decade later in trump pitched the story to lifetime which presented its own disgusting irony the likely sexual predator wanted his story on a network known for producing shows about sexual predators trumps mr robinson has refused to comment on the book however if one were so inclined they are able to read the first few chapters for free on amazons kindle version using the preview option that is all one should read for two reasons the first is purchasing the book would put money in trumps pocket and the second is ingesting the entire story will likely lead to psychosis the loss of brain cells and points
