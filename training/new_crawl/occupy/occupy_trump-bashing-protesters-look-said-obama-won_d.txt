protests have broken out every night since donald trump was elected president by the electoral college prompting republicans to waggle their fingers and chastise the left for refusing to accept the results trump himself wasted no time in complaining how unfair it was but that stands in stark contrast to what he was saying in following president landslide victory when he called for america to march on washington and railed against the phony electoral college accusing president of an illegitimate victory because he lost the popular vote as usual the facts tell a very different story president won the popular vote by to against john and against mitt to secretary won the popular vote by a substantial margin almost two million more votes but the phony electoral college has left us with donald trump as our the protesters have every right to make their displeasure with the electoral college handing the presidency to an admitted sexual predator and outspoken bigot trumps hypocrisy is on display for the world to see once again
