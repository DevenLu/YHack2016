the shell shock of donald trump being elected president is beginning to wear off and democrats liberals and other members of the left are coming together to devise a plan to impede trumps impending presidency one of trumps most vocal and visible critics michael moore is explaining why trump wont be in office for a full four years before trump shocked the entire world with his victory moore warned of trumps possible victory in june think theres an excellent chance of donald trump becoming the next president of the us said last august he would be the republican nominee had the world listened to moore rather than pretending trumps candidacy was an impossibility to come to fruition we may not be in this position now moore is making the rounds on cable networks making his case as to how trump can be stopped while a guest on morning joe moore promised for there to be ongoing demonstrations in the streets against trumps presidency we are going to resist we are going to oppose these demonstrations seeing in streets when in places like milwaukee and nashville not exactly berkeley and ann arbor alright this is going to continue tonight and the next night and all he has to do is nominate as attorney general and things like that or his supreme court beyond mere demonstrations which give voice to the agony and rage of those who participate all is not lost moore whose track record of predictions included trumps victory offered a vision of trumps presidency that included him being impeached because trump will not be able to stop himself from committing criminal acts while in office leading to his impeachment let me just say heres why we going to have to suffer through four years of donald trump because he has no ideology except the ideology of donald trump and when you have a narcissist like that so narcissistic where its all about him he will maybe unintentionally break laws he will break laws because only thinking about whats best for him moore continued to elaborate on his vision of the active resistance that is forming to stand against trumps brand of hatred bigotry division and fear which includes a million woman march on inauguration day this is going to be a massive resistance theres already women calling for a million woman march on inauguration day and theres going to be the largest demonstration ever and there will be demonstrations then but we are also going to organize never seen anything like this everything they were going to do to the obstruction they did to for years and putting her on trial for impeachment the best predictor of future behavior is past behavior trump has a documented history of lying cheating and cutting corners it would be a highly dramatic turn of events for him to suddenly begin playing by the rules particularly now that he is going to sit in the most powerful office in the world where he can pardon himself if finds himself on the wrong end of a conviction no trump will surely break the law once he becomes president and then the will fall to the american people to ensure that justice is carried out and trump is removed from power watch the full segment with moore below
