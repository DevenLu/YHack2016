a particularly contentious moment during last nights debate surrounded the topic of abortion specifically abortion trumps opinion on this issue was typical trump his response was meant to inspire fear and without taking the full situation into context his thoughts on abortion are as follows think its terrible if you go with what is saying in the ninth month you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb of the mother just prior to the birth of the baby now you can say that thats okay and can say that thats okay but its not okay with me because based on what she is saying and based on where she is going and where she has been you can take the baby and rip the baby out of the womb in the ninth month on the final day and thats not acceptable responded with a resounding defense of roe wade which has been praised she spoke for the women and men that demand this highly personal amendment be protected trumps gross misunderstanding of abortion prompted draper from utah to come forward with her story of undergoing the medically necessary procedure her story has since gone viral what had to go through was highly traumatic but it was also highly was between her and her her and the government full story is share it with anyone who does not understand what abortion involves had a late term abortion it is nothing like described by trump please base your vote on the fear mongering he is doing please read my experience had to have a late term abortion it was the worst moment in my life what made it even worse was the state of utah had made it illegal had one dead twin the other had severe and would only have lived with life support in great pain for a few days lay on the hospital floor bawling hysterically for twelve hours waiting for an ethics committee of the health care corporation to decide my case justified what had to be done my health was in danger due to the dead fetus my husband and consulted our bishop who assured me needed to do what had to do that it was even within guidelines to do so he reminded me had six kids at home who needed their mother to live the abortion was terrible it was done very gently by caesarean section leaving the babies in their amniotic sacs the living baby passed very quickly it was horrific think it even affected my dear physician as he had never had to end a pregnancy before developed for which had to be treated for years mostly because of the fact had to have it at all no woman should have to have the state have a say in the most painful decision she will ever make nobody is tearing babies apart in late term they are always humanely done only in situations where there is a or severely defective fetus the mothers health is at risk please vote for a candidate or a party that would make these decisions for the women who will die or be forced to carry fetuses to term this is a decision that is so painful and so terrible only the parents of the baby and a physician should be involved in the decision
