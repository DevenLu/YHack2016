universally reviled republican governor rick scott and his appointed secretary of state ken were just handed a vicious rebuke from a federal judge over their scheme to disenfranchise floridian voters and throw tens of thousands of ballots into the trash district judge mark walker accused scott and of delaying a hearing on a voting rights lawsuit so that he could use every second available to run out the clock and said their stalling amounted to an undeclared war on the right to vote the democratic party of florida has filed a lawsuit against the state over the issue of ballots many of which often have no signatures due to forgetful voters or the signatures match the one on file the lawsuit demands that voters be given a chance to rectify the signature issue rather than simply rejecting them as the state of florida did with votes in but scott and his minions are stalling a scheduling hearing was set by the judge but demanded they have a week to respond at the end of which they declared offer no witnesses and no evidence if one were skeptical it would appear that the florida secretary of state requested as much time as he felt he could possibly justify so that he could use every second available to run out the clock and by wasting a week on his scintillating response he quite nearly succeeded said a livid judge walker he ruled that voters should have a chance to fix the mistakes and placed the duty on county officials to let voters know they have until the day before the election to rectify their signatures the state of florida will not appeal florida is long known as a hotbed for republican corruption and has a history of voter disenfranchisement kudos to the democratic party for fighting to ensure that every americans right to vote is exercised and shame on rick scott for his sinister machinations
