dedicated people that we live in a free country and we owe of our freedoms to this small group of individuals many families around county creeks and lakes have fond memories and are still creating memories of good times spent on the water one group the spring creek coalition has been working to allow the continued use of the creek waters for us all to enjoy washington much of the debate over guns during the presidential campaign has focused on big proposals to expand background checks for gun sales or restore a national assault weapons ban but a series of smaller steps by the administration during the past several years have enraged gun rights supporters besides a highly publicized expansion of background checks for sales and purchases in january about a dozen other white house actions show how much the next president can affect gun policy even without congressional approval gun rights advocates say the moves have included barring a type of ammunition and halting the import of guns collected by some enthusiasts advocates of gun restrictions say the steps are necessary given congress unwillingness to pass such controls as universal background checks despite large support in national opinion polls the white house is limited in terms of what they can do without the backing and support of congress president and his administration have explored all possibilities in response to the violence said po chairman of the action alliance founded after the shootings at sandy hook elementary school in an interview gun rights supporters say a administration would be more

president of the campaign to prevent gun violence and a former republican mayor of fort wayne indiana said has pretty much everything he really can without submitting it for congressional still even changes that do not fundamentally alter the right to own a firearm have angered gun rights supporters for example in july the state department updated the definition of who must register as an arms manufacturer and pay a annual fee under an international arms trafficking law its definition included some work like threading gun barrels considered regular the department did say most work on guns require registration as long as special machinery is not involved and the work improve weapons accuracy or firepower still the and some members of congress saw the move as burdening gun owners also under the administration the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives banned the import of ammunition for assault rifles that was considered a federal judge upheld the ban earlier this year

try tinkering with the margins such steps have helped protect police somewhat said who noted that more powerful ammunition is much the reason that police are becoming more militarized but in truth many kinds of readily available ammunition can pierce police vests he said unable to get congress to pass background checks for all gun sales the administration has also taken steps to expand them on its own most notably in january it announced clarifications widening checks on sales and for purchases the administration previously closed what vice president joe had described as an artful dodge allowing felons and others barred from having guns to avoid background checks by registering machine guns and other weapons to a trust or a corporation in response to restrictions the said the move displays the administrations typical bias and instinct to further burden and discourage lawful gun ownership on the same day as the action barred military weapons sold or donated by the to overseas
