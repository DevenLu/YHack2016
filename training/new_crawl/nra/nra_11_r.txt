mike is quietly finishing as one of the biggest spenders of the cycle the former new york city mayor adamant about his political independence and gives to republicans and democrats who align with positions he wants comes into election day having donated more than million overwhelmingly to issue campaigns for local gun control and soda tax measures but also to individual candidates story continued below thats all happened with very little public presence and include a single dollar toward the presidential race putting just behind tom in total federal contributions and well ahead of what has put into white house senate and house races this year giving is all focused on the environment goes across the republican spectrum but with a special tilt toward fellow on israel policy the brothers have built a massive network with almost billion in spending this cycle that often comes in to reshape key races in pursuit of republican wins for conservative causes backs a mix of republican and democrats has become more focused on referenda and his operation is contained to a small team of advisers stayed in his orbit from his days in city hall no one in the country operates this way said who runs the effort along with longtime political guru consciously made his donald speech at the democratic convention in july his final statement in the white house campaign opting against giving money to already super pacs or television appearances to reinforce the message aides point out that other than the short speech made as the host mayor during the convention and his endorsement of via in and of course taking yet another look at running for president himself this year he has mostly avoided getting directly involved in campaigning this is the most aggressive he has ever been for any presidential candidate he felt that strongly about this election said when you speak rarely it carries more power and that applied here the convention speech was most effective standing on its own backed six senate candidates and six house candidates including some personal friends like arizona john and new york rep dan donovan but the real money in federal races came not from out under federal giving limits or hosting as he also did for illinois mark kirk california senate candidate harris and massachusetts rep but from pac spending around gun control independence usa pac put million in ads behind pennsylvania pat for his leadership on gun control legislation after the shooting and punished new hampshire for voting against it with million in ads backing her opponent gov maggie while donated another million to planned parenthood votes to further boost that kind of spending can drive people in both parties nuts as spoke in philadelphia that night at the convention calling trump a con and a dangerous demagogue some democrats in the wells center were grumbling about how he could be standing there when he was supporting the republican candidate in that very state when they argue a democratic majority would be better for gun control overall but said help people who were with him on background checks like and punish the people who were against him thats effective in its own way said josh holmes a former chief of staff to senate majority leader now the president and founding partner of and is a major player in this years battle for senate control if going to posture as though going to pay a price by taking a vote for or against an issue that you care about then you follow up on it or you but if you people wont take you seriously said holmes adding that he wished might think more about the percent of issues the new yorker probably agreed with on but knew that going to happen elsewhere gave each to the races of oregon gov brown washington gov jay and north carolina gubernatorial candidate cooper and hosted a for island gov he also dropped into the pennsylvania attorney general campaign of josh and into joe pennsylvania state treasurer campaign but the real money came in referenda pushes he takes a different approach said first no partisan boundaries and he believe someone has to agree with him on every issue second he is not going to pour in money where there is already an ocean of money engulfing a race he targets the dollars more narrowly where his spending is going to have a tangible and hopefully decisive impact for instance gave million to education initiatives focused on expanding charter schools in massachusetts louisiana and california between spending by for gun safety which founded and largely funds and money given directly million went to state gun control measures in nevada maine and washington state pursuing the issue even though his own mayoral ban on large drink sizes was later struck down by a court in new york has already spent million dollars on the soda tax issue say he may hit million by promoting a soda tax in oakland calif and san francisco thats included running what his team calls a comprehensive media plan and direct contributions to the committees separately put million supporting the philadelphia soda tax effort million into television and digital ads to support the cook county ill effort and made a contribution to healthier colorado a thats involved in the effort there fortune is estimated to be upward of billion having that kind of cash to draw on and no future political ambitions to worry about since he nixed this years independent white house run gives him a unique freedom picks his targets wisely and executes holmes said they spend a lot of time wringing their hands in the press
