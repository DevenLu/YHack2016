a proposed amendment to the kansas constitution making hunting fishing and trapping a constitutional right has brought a lot of surprises many voters know theres such an item on the ballot been surprised how quickly some saw nothing but evil within the proposed amendment some claim that if passed the proposed amendment would destroy wildlife management as we know it others have lit up the complaining it could strip landowners of rights and insure hunters anglers and trappers could go anywhere anytime heres the wording the people have the right to hunt fish and trap including by the use of traditional methods subject to reasonable laws and regulations that promote wildlife conservation and management and that preserve the future of hunting and fishing public hunting and fishing shall be a preferred means of managing and controlling wildlife this section shall not be construed to modify any provision of law relating to trespass property rights or water resources the national rifle association helped get the proposal rolling then federal and state representatives of the group have declined interviews with me about it rep adam played the main role in getting the concept pushed through the legislature he has not returned calls since an initial interview the kansas department of wildlife parks and tourism has has some information on its but more exposure and explanation of the proposed amendment could have soothed a lot of fears comprehend whats written most of the concerns hear are the feared power such an amendment would give to hunters many think it would mean hunters would be exempt from seasons limits and having to buy permits input from professional biologists and the states wildlife commission and state agencies would also be no more one person feared endangered species could legally be hunted thats not what the proposed amendment though poorly worded says it directly says hunting rights would be subject to reasonable laws and regulations that promote wildlife conservation and management wildlife and parks attorney has repeatedly said he has faith his department would retain management and laws some have asserted passage of the amendment would mean hunting and fishing would be the only ways to manage wildlife the proposal says public hunting and fishing shall be a preferred as in one of the possibly several means of managing fish and wildlife nowhere does it say those are the preferred means of management so far states have placed almost identical amendments yet to find where it leads to problems texas alabama nebraska and others still have active game and fish departments the wildlife still belongs to the people of those states and there is a long list of regulations hunters anglers and trappers must obey in the past wildlife and parks has not supported proposed amendments similar to this this one they do think our state game department would support anything that takes management and income out of their hands but some do my biggest concern was making sure poachers could still be adequately punished suspension of hunting rights from one year to forever may be our most dreaded and effective punishment once worried the same but is now secure that judges can still hand out any punishment thats been used in recent years to get to the ballot the proposed amendment had to get through both state houses it did so with more than percent approval from representatives and senators after months of discussions that says quite a bit common sense also questions if the amendment is really needed since hunters anglers and trappers are already pretty well protected in kansas if it passes theres no guarantee groups end or severely limit the ability to hunt fish and trap in kansas if there is even a chance it could protect us for it if nothing else think it shows respect to a group of kansans who have a combined impact of more than million annually on the states economy and raise more than million through licenses fees and excise taxes to fund conservation efforts in kansas
