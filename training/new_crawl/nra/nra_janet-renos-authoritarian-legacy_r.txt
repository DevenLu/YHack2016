told a group of federal law enforcement officers in you are part of a government that has given its people more freedom than any other government in the history of the world miss spin turned the declaration of independence on its head as if freedom is a crumb that rulers sweep off their table as a favor for the citizenry in a speech to government prosecutors miss reno declared all of you public lawyers are but little lower than the angels and salute you she showed her belief in angels in when she decreed that federal prosecutors would no longer be restrained by the ethics guidelines of state bar associations prohibiting all lawyers from contacting defendants directly without their lawyers present miss power grab for federal prosecutors was unanimously condemned by the conference of chief justices representing all the state supreme courts as attorney general miss reno stretched the law every chance she got in order to expand the lists of americans punishable by the justice
