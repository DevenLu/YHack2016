a proposition aimed at reducing the amount of ammunition that ends up in the hands of people who have it is causing some uproar among gun owners and sellers most are skeptical the proposed law proposition will actually reduce crime or violence but if supporters of the news rules get their way gun owners could soon be turning their magazines over and paying more for bullets whenever the government says keeping you safe you can take it to the bank that all trying to do is take away your liberties said rod williams owner of us tactical and sporting arms disarming the people will never save anyone on voters will decide whether they agree with williams or support the tighter restrictions a angeles times poll shows percent support the bill while percent oppose it comes as no surprise that san francisco and angeles the largest voting blocks in the state overwhelming support the restrictions percent but in county opposition is strong it makes my skin crawl that they packaged it as safety for all williams said prop bullet points there are a number of proposed changes but the greatest impact on gun dealers and owners involves the sale of ammunition prop would require people wanting to buy ammunition to obtain a license through the department of justice dealers would then need to perform a background check before selling the ammunition there would be a nominal fee added to every ammunition purchase in addition to a registration fee the law would add at least to every box of ammunition it has not been determined how much this will cost dealers the proposed law also addressed magazines creates a process of getting registered guns out of the hands of convicted felons and imposes fines when owners report guns stolen or lost if passed the law would go into effect in january opponents of the bill believe these restrictions will create for ammunition and will do little to protect the public from guns getting into the hands of criminals stout owner of gunslingers said the measure only places greater restrictions on law abiding citizens its not going stop someone from driving to the arizona border and buying ammo he said if buying ammo from my cousins uncles brother now going to do that after this law is passed however some believe it could benefit local dealers and the economy its going to be a positive because it will get rid of sales said scott james a private firearms dealer and enthusiast it could increase tax revenue locally regulation leads to confiscation background checks would be processed through the already overburdened stout said stout and manager of gunslingers are concerned about the impact it will have on wait times the is already so backed up stout said it takes three months to process concealed weapons sometimes longer its impossible that these new laws are not going to backup the even more but is also concerned with the government monitoring how much ammunition she buys she goes to the range often and uses more than rounds in a month nowhere in the bill does it restrict how much ammunition can be purchased at any given time she still worries if buy rounds to go to the range is that going to look suspicious she wondered theres a saying gun owners use regulation leads to confiscation however hunters selling rounds or less per month for hunting will not be required to apply for a license according to the ballot measure williams believes that more regulation increases the likelihood that one day the government will overturn the second amendment however unlikely that may seem he said he quoted sherlock holmes when you have eliminated the impossible whatever remains however improbable must be the truth closing the loopholes the measure would also close a number of loopholes in current gun control laws magazines were banned in those who owned magazines before that time were allowed to keep them but urged to turn them in prop would remove that exemption and owners of magazines would have to turn them into local law enforcement or face jail time believes this law much like registering to buy ammunition is pointless if go to the range with a magazine going to get it confiscated and kicked off the range she said is this going to be sheriff mike said zero people turned magazines into the sheriffs department when the first law was passed and he know if anyone will if prop is passed he added that he have the resources to go checking to see if people are stashing magazines that mean he wont enforce a law just that deputies will be focused on crimes if this passes and hope it we will have literally created thousands of criminals it would be very difficult with our resources to check said am all about making our communities safer but this the way people who violate the law will continue to violate the law the sheriff suggested more severe penalties for those who do use guns during a crime to help deter violence although james feels the measure will increase tax revenue and supports gun control he agrees with the sheriff those who are not allowed to buy guns and ammunition will still find people who are willing to risk jail time to buy guns for them he said bad guys are going to get what they want james added more restrictions more costs not included in the measure are recently signed assembly bill and senate bill which would reclassify rifles as assault weapons the laws take effect next year it is currently illegal for gun dealers to sell assault weapons they can however sell weapons such as the popular the the weapons are built with magazine locking devices more commonly known as bullet buttons but with the new laws any gun with a bullet button is reclassified as an assault rifle gun dealers say theres a way around it but again it hinders sellers from being a bullet button cover or mag lock adds a step to the process making it harder to reload it also adds per gun its really going to affect our business it could be the last straw for local gun shops said andrew manager of us tactical we are already competing with big chain stores our hands are tied
