and advocates expressed their frustrations during the final of four meetings of the senates gun issues special committee which has traveled the state taking testimony from citizens to determine if the states gun laws should be reformed the final meeting was held thursday at the state houses building in a room with a capacity of people the largest available but far smaller than during previous meetings held in larger halls the lack of space forced many speakers to arrive early and tension from ardent supporters on both sides was visible in the faces of attendees some debated the merits of making changes to state law even before the meeting started about attendees were sent to an overflow room set up on a separate floor where the meeting was streamed the meeting lasted until almost with senators making closing remarks who pushed for extending the waiting period for background checks to days during the legislative session vowed to again push for reform to close the charleston loophole legislators legislation for the upcoming session in december what we heard over the last four meetings think is compelling evidence that the people of south carolina want comprehensive expanded background checks said to be clear this is not about taking away peoples guns this is about making sure that people who are unfit to have guns are properly screened with enough time from the federal government to make that decision and get the decision back to the gun dealer about people spoke thursday with a slight majority leaning in favor of gun reform among the speakers was columbia police chief skip who called for stiffer penalties for those who illegally posses firearms after saying we have a problem with guns being in the hands of the wrong people simply say doing nothing is not acceptable said the difficulty is finding the balance the sweet spot the right thing to do and that is challenging said that there is a need for a comprehensive ability to conduct background checks and that computer systems should be able to communicate with each other he added there should be severe consequences for those who commit violent crimes on our citizens before and after there were calls for citizens to protect themselves and for lawmakers to not interfere with their ability to do so scott parks of county told legislators what was best was for them to pass constitutional carry legislation which would allow south carolinians to carry concealed weapons without a permit every human being has the right to defend their selves their property their loved ones and their neighbors parks said believe that what may help in this situation and may decrease the violence with people choosing to break the laws would be more people who can defend and are willing to help others in doing so with a tool that is best efficient for that job and at this time in most cases that is a firearm but there were also many calls for reform including from faith a who is frustrated with the drills she has been forced to participate in as a student this is not the society that we want to live in said we live in a different society ask you to make a change and protect not only children but adults and all of the people who are victims or possible victims of gun violence before todays hearing the gun issues special committee has held meetings throughout the state heres what previous speakers have told the panel we know that the man who killed my husband should have not been able to buy the gun that was used to kill him it was human error that permitted that purchase that happened but it was a law that limited the amount of time for record review that allowed an oversight to become a fatality widow of need the right to defend myself and my family need to be infringed upon of county thoughts and prayers do not legislate people do and so far we have failed miserably of north charleston guns do not kill people people kill people if not with a gun it will be with a knife or a hammer and we have seen that andrew of
