the debate over question is increasingly focused on language that would require background checks before could loan guns to each other an issue that has allowed opponents to rally hunters and other gun owners against the ballot measure the gap between supporters and opponents of question on the ballot appears to be narrowing with one week left until election day while most major ballot initiatives in maine see their support wane as the election nears question witnessed a significant drop in support from percent to percent while the opposition increased by points from percent to percent according to two portland press herald polls conducted roughly five weeks apart supporters downplayed the results and suggested the polling conducted already was dated we feel comfortable we are in a stronger position than that poll shows although we are not going to complain about a lead said david farmer spokesman for for responsible gun ownership the campaign behind question but a leading opponent suggested that the costly campaign could be undone by the organizers decision to require background checks before gun loans or transfers in addition to the background checks that are the primary focus of question in my opinion this legislation only had to be one paragraph do you want to require background checks for firearms sales on the private market period said david executive director of the alliance of maine it probably would have passed with to percent of the vote and that approach would have been more genuine question aims to close what supporters contend is a dangerous loophole in maine gun laws that could allow convicted felons domestic abusers and individuals with mental illness to acquire guns that is because unlike purchases made from federally licensed gun dealers private transactions in maine do not require the buyers name to be run through the national instant criminal background check system but question also would require people who want to loan or gift a gun to a to bring the firearm to a licensed dealer in order to run a background check on the recipient the dealer can charge a reasonable fee and under the language of the law the process would need to be repeated when the gun is transferred back the proposal exempts transactions between family members for law enforcement or when a gun is needed to protect someone from imminent harm or death loans for hunting or sport shooting also would be exempt but only if the lender and recipient hunt or shoot together the alliance and gun owners of maine have hammered the loaner gun issue in mailers and other communications and the national rifle association which has funneled roughly million into the campaign so far featured the transfers issue in its first television ad and other opponents are banking on the same dynamics that sank a referendum to ban bear baiting and trapping when sportsmen and many rural strongly opposed the initiative and just as they successfully portrayed the bear referendum as being spearheaded by interests in that case the humane society of the united states the and colleagues are accusing question supporters of doing the bidding of former new york city mayor michael for gun safety which is gun control organization has pumped more than million into the maine campaign our point from the beginning is and his could have written a law to address that issue private sales that would have closed the loophole and addressed the problem with minimal impact on gun owners said this law is drastically overwritten farmer the spokesman for for responsible gun ownership accused opponents of grossly exaggerating the proposals impacts on hunters as a scare tactic in the final weeks of the campaign but farmer also cited examples of murders in other states many of them incidents of domestic violence committed by individuals who borrowed a gun from someone else he also cited a case in which a maine man was interviewed by federal law enforcement after a gun he traded away turned up at a crime scene that is exactly why transfers are included in this farmer said when you have so many guns available on the private market if you include transfers you leave a gaping hole that allows guns to fall into the wrong hands without a background check in response to the rhetoric over gun transfers for responsible gun ownership has launched two television ads during the past month featuring hunters who support question and also posted an video rebutting some claims made by gov paul who opposes the ballot measure mark of south portland is one hunter who plans to vote against the bill largely because of the mandatory background checks on transfers and cited a situation from less than two weeks ago as an example of why he opposes the proposal the son of a friend had wanted to try hunting with a shotgun than he had previously used so said he borrowed a from a fellow gun club member before the group headed to the north woods sporting camp upon trying the however the young man decided he preferred the smaller caliber gun after all fortunately said he had brought a backup gun for just that situation but had question requirement been in effect the boy would have been able to hunt only if had gone out with the boy and his father we were miles northwest of and there are no towns up there said this kids weekend would have been ruined question supporters often counter that the temporary inconvenience of background checks is dramatically outweighed by the prospect of saving lives by prohibiting criminals from acquiring guns jim a political science professor at the university of maine at was surprised that the yes on campaign had not done more to respond to the discussion over hunting until recently said opponents could be pursuing a strategy similar to what they did with the bear referendum in but he said question appears to enjoy broader support headed into election day that said noted that major ballot initiatives often lose support as the election approaches and question is no exception the big question he said could be whether backers of republican presidential nominee donald trump whose conservative supporters might be more likely to oppose question will turn out in large numbers think it is going to be dead even headed into election day said my hunch is it is going to fail narrowly but believe it is going to be close responding to the claims of opponents farmer said colorado and washington state have both put in place similar background check laws in recent years with little impact on the sporting community while farmer said supporters never felt question would be a runaway campaign he repeated that they are in a strong position headed into the election remain confident that voters in maine will pass this reform he said a friend and go hunting and on the way home stop for gas go into the store to pay for gas leaving my rifle in the car with my friend the way the law is written that is a transfer upon my return to the car another transfer under the law has just been made under the law my friend and each have just committed a felony unauthorized if somehow enforceable my friend and would face huge fines jail time and lose our gun rights for life this is what and his minions call common sense served on a federal jury this past year and learned exactly what possession and control mean under the law you are wrong and is correct in his interpretation of this situation and how the law would see it if you pick up a gun that is not yours even in a gun shop that gun is in your possession as you alone control it crazy yes but thats how the law sees it we asked a federal judge to explain that to us before having to convict someone of illegal possession in such a case the transfer would be legal because it was in a licensed gun shop in the case of this initiatives language in the field but in a car or your home if you stepped out and left a gun in the house with a friend who exempt thats a transfer under this initiative not a lawyer but heard several explain this concept thats why sensible voters should vote no exactly and thats the problem with this law the way its written its vague and lacks legal clarification it should be defeated and then revised to be clearer and more specific and less broad and it should be heartily and reasonably debated by people whose job it is to pay attention to these details our legislature then most reasonable people would support it believe know several gun owners who want to support this for its intent but what it actually says is way beyond its intent and so due diligence requires defeating it and trying again with a better alternative cant volunteer have never and will never own a gun its just a person philosophy was under the impression the legislature could make technical changes that do not change the intent of the law do not believe this law intends to prohibit pit stops or housesitting think leaving a gun in an unlocked closet or via other access is really irresponsible gun ownership guns should be in safes or locked gun cabinets especially when the home is empty am not sure believe it would even be a long way through the judicial system intent has a pretty specific meaning in the legal system but this is one definition determination to perform a particular act or to act in a particular manner for a specific reason an aim or design a resolution to use a certain means to reach an end there is no specific end meant to transfer in the or the housesitting scenario you are correct but you gone far enough now look up transfer in title section paragraph a it states transfer means to sell furnish give lend deliver or otherwise provide with or without consideration so stopping at a gas station or leaving a friend is not exempt alone your home with a gun in your closet say who is then legally in possession of your gun would be a crime in the minutes you are away from your car and your gun they are in your friends possession my other comments and you have provided him or her with that gun without consideration the law is precise and thats how lawyers can get cops drunk drivers off of charges they know how to parse a sentence or a paragraph and they argue finer points of semantics than we average folks do but we think we can make laws not always good ones alas thats why voting no makes sense in this case get the consideration part and in fact a felon might still be considered to be in possession but the person leaving the gun in the car had no intent to transfer any gun with or without consideration would argue that even title denotes an intention sell furnish give lend deliver etc are all words of positive action leaving a gun in a car while you relieve yourself in a is a passive act with no intent to transfer that gun and think the way the law is written a judge would find for a person so accused the way this law is currently worded another good point we should be getting paid huh you did leave out otherwise provide from the list of situations however agree the other verbs indicate intent yet if you leave someone with a gun you are providing them an opportunity to use it feloniously however that may be but that is the language of the law and cost us taxpayers and some poor test case a bushel of money to have lawyers argue over that in a courtroom that money would be better off going to education or to supplement living wages for folks who serve food its a grain of sand a pebble in the fine machinery of the law and its going to cause problems later down the road thats why will vote no much as am for better gun policies you must think gun owners in maine are idiots if leave my gun in the control of my friend in my car while go take a piss wilfully and intentionally left my gun in the car with my friend and that friend now has complete control over my gun if this situation does not meet the standard of the law concerning furnish lend deliver or other wise provide then the whole law it self is meaningless you are asking us to read the words of the law and come to a conclusion that is neither logical or a result of following the rules of the english language it reminds me very much of you can keep your doctor if you want guess what you words do not what does matter is the words in this law and their meaning is clear as despite your best effort to imitate correct there is no intent in that scenario but there is a delivery if get out of my car and leave a bill on the seat between me and you may not be intending to deliver it to you but by definition in this initiative have in fact provided you an opportunity to use it intend to deliver actually did that makes me a and that on the seat is a transfer at least as read it and for the literal thinkers who may read this and then say off topic or stupid the is a metaphor for a gun or a symbol or an analogy pick your terms and then we can begin a whole new debate over like this one please point out in the proposed law where ownership is mentioned who the gun belongs to is not part of the law the definition of transfer is clear as day it does not matter who owns it or what the intent is if you provide deliver furnish give or lend a gun to another person then you have transferred the gun if a person is in possession of or in control of the gun as in the bathroom break scenario above the law has been violated if you really want to continue to assert that intention of a change of ownership is needed to be in violation of this then please quote the part of the law that states so do not just insert your words into the law that is just laughable am not supporting anything am very much undecided on this bill because know hunting is very important to maine am not sure what the contribution of out of state people who come here for hunting is but do believe this bill could have a very chilling effect on that and that is not something want to support am not have chosen not to own one but if did would follow all of the safety measures could with a small child in the house if you leave yours around feel free value this life way more than any gun am not making anything up read the text of the bill instead of todays talking points that is one interpretation of the law but am not sure it is correct the law defines exceptions and has definitions which are critical am not sure the law covers some situations like leaving the vehicle to get coffee or use the nor does it address leaving guns in home with or having someone watch the house and it maybe that those are just not considered transfers because you are not giving them your gun nor your refrigerator or your oven know relevance but just see those situations as a transfer nor does the law specify that maybe it is an oversight or maybe it is because there is no transfer the firearm is a curio or relic or note are two different conditions it does not say and the maine chiefs of police association which claims membership of more than active and retired chiefs and sheriffs across the state endorsed voting in favor of a ballot question that would tighten state gun control laws in addition seven southern maine police chiefs stood actually am not or choose not to own one based on personal philosophy but if do vote no on this question it will solely for the chilling effect on hunters and hunting never said hunters are old drunks or hicks however most of those know going away hunting pack more beer than any other provision that does not mean that any of them would be drunk while using a firearm it raises the possibility but that is on them and not my affair that response was supposed to be humor sorry it touched such a sore spot with you given all those regulations you listed on vehicle ownership and use how come there are still so many deaths how come people still drive suspended why do cars still get stolen and used by criminals what about rental cars by third parties a straw used extensively to bring drugs into our state we already allowed to lend our guns to people who allowed to own them do you call the to make sure your friend has a valid license before allowing them to use your car lots of people drive with a suspended license and know it claim to not know thought the same thing until a closer examination showed me something go back to the clause it states one of the exclusions is if the transfer is temporary it then goes on to qualify that by adding that the transfer and the possession of the firearm take place exclusively and then it lists out situations they are a range a competition while hunting or trapping or if both parties are not together at one of these events in the actual presence of the so that means to me the two people have to be together either at some sanctioned event or anywhere else but they have to be together thats the problem and if not sure what possession means under the law scroll back up these comments to my previous reply to and you can see what also learned thats why informed citizens are voting no on this would vote for less restrictive clearer restrictions but this is poorly written legislation in its entirety the transfer is temporary the has no reason to believe that the transferee intends to use the firearm in the commission of a crime and the transfer and the possession of the firearm take place exclusively transfer and the possession of the firearm at an established shooting range authorized by the governing body of the jurisdiction in which such range is located or if no such authorization is required operated consistently with local law in such jurisdiction any transfer allowed by this paragraph is permitted only if the has no reason to believe that the transferee is disqualified to possess firearms under state or federal law or if the transferee is under years of age and is receiving the firearm under direct supervision and control of an adult that such adult is disqualified to possess firearms under state or federal law or what if my close friend and both pass background checks at least monthly if not weekly we own guns and he owns guns making us drive to a federally licensed business twice pay fees twice as well as draft a document that states am not transferring ownership but rather lending my property to him for the afternoon all for what that does not help anybody and if the only time we can meet up is after work outside of normal business hours then what it is an infringement on our rights and would destroy heritage and traditions even the majority of our police oppose question well since most family members are exempt from this bill it would not apply to a domestic abuser getting his brother parent or cousin to get a firearm for him aside from the existing laws that are already on the book id like to see some data on how many people in maine are gunned down by their spouses and spouses that have a criminal record that would prohibit them from passing a background check would think its extremely rare but of course the billionaire in new york would have you believe it is rampant in our little corner of the world the comment was not intended to be a commentary of this law although that is the discussion his name was mentioned like he a fictional character he is not he did use a gun to kill have to wonder if this law might have made a seller think twice about that deal but honestly doubt it would have made any difference am still very much undecided on how will vote on this but most of the mass shooters while they have obtained weapons legally have had some serious mental health issues have to wonder if family members might take more notice of these people and guns that they have cant think of a single instance in maine where it would have made a difference but what about future instances just know the bill also defines a as a person with an intent to transfer leaving your gun in the car does not transfer the firearm because there is no intent there is no there can be no transferee and thus no transfer you have done none of the above sell furnish give lend deliver or other provide because you have not intended that person to have or take the firearm if you step out of your car and leave it running you do not expect the person in the car with you to take your car you did not give permission for that and there is not a court in the land that would see that as consent so why it is it different with your firearm in the vehicle it guess it would be too much to ask them to focus on criminals instead of the good guys these leftists are charlatans and what they really want is to keep tabs on transfers between mothers fathers brothers sisters sons daughters uncles cousins friends and neighbors after inheritances and gifts also after the sales of inherited collections however small they are new york california et already have begun by comparing death certificates to permits and taking guns from widows clearly they give a hoot about nuts and felons they want us because were the source of their money but nailed the bottom line when he affirmed the natural right of resistance and when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression voters are beginning to realize the scale here the down side is far more than an inconvenience to some of our friends fact is its a colossal intimidation of an entire state population particularly current firearms owners some even see our nations headlong gallop toward political leftism socialism beginning to realize its a flimflam obviously leftist forces in this nation have absolutely no interest in nuts felons or even terrorists universal registration is their goal and they see it as their path to wealth and power voters seem to be catching on to the fact that registration is a long way beyond universal background checks you are correct about my not working would not call my pension or my social security an entitlement contributed to that program from the time was and working full time to support my family after my dad died also completed high school with honors and went on to college have actually fired a gun but it is not something enjoy so no own a gun have that right in this country no was never in the military my mother died while was in college just a few years after my dad so continued to finish college working hour days on the weekend to support and raise the year old and year old left behind am not ashamed of that choice if it bothers you tough as to whether will pass this or any of the other questions time will tell
