sanders has so far resisted telling his fellow democrats that he told them so when it came to focusing on voters but not taking defeat sitting down either according to the progressive candidate not ruling out a second run at the white house and going to be flexing his muscle in the democratic national previous administration worked hard to alienate him from the candidate selection process four years is a long time from now sanders told media on thursday well take one thing at a time but not ruling out anything he went on to call the democratic defeat an embarrassment saying that biggest hurdle was her failure to appeal to the white working class it is an embarrassment think to the entire democratic party that millions of white people decided to vote for mr trump which suggests that the democratic message of standing up for working people no longer holds much sway among workers in this country indeed many democrats have followed up loss by blaming the working class for their lack of some even going so far as to call white rural voters who make up a large share of the blue collar sanders may be correct in saying that a class warfare message resonated with the electorate but that donald trump was able to capitalize on voter uneasiness better than in the meantime before sanders is working on a coup to push the much further to the left joining with elizabeth warren loudly voicing his choice in the leadership fight sanders seemed like a natural for democratic national committee chairman but he will back minnesota representative instead himself a progressive who supported sanders against in the primary said he would take the weekend to decide whether to run for chair in addition to being a sanders ally predicted trumps the importance of the working class year but no one listened if sanders plans on making a second run at the democratic nomination however hell have to start soon presidential campaigns started an average of days before election day in meaning that small operations are likely already coming together
