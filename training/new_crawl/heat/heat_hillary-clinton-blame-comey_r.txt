suffered a humiliating loss to donald trump on election day bringing her record in presidential campaigns to few pundits saw this coming its unlikely the campaign saw this coming either and now her top staffers are struggling to explain what happened the most obvious answer that was an atrociously flawed candidate and to appeal to an electorate desperate for change in washington is not one that her top advisers are prepared to accept right now campaign chairman john blamed his candidates defeat on others specifically fbi director james as well as the media in what must have been an awkward conference call with pissed off donors described as someone who we think may have cost us the election many democrats lashed out at after the fbi director announced days before the election that new evidence had been uncovered in the bureaus investigation into the private server used to conduct government business as secretary of state some accused him of trying to rig the election in trumps favor that last week it was just one too many things communications aide reportedly said on the call according to the hill publicly announced on november that the new evidence did not change the bureaus initial decision not to pursue charges against some have suggested that one way democrats could have avoided potentially damaging revelations from the fbi director is by not nominating a candidate under fbi investigation for subverting public records laws also faulted the media for being unfair to the media always covered her as the person who would be president and therefore tried to eviscerate her before the election but covered trump who was someone who was entertaining and sort of gave him a pass he said we need to reflect and analyze that and put our voices forward sure whatever you say this is unlikely to fly with democratic loyalists such as national committee staffer who lashed out at the party during a meeting for backing a flawed candidate
