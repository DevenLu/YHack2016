@publicans_sd44 @aaronhorak thats why many moved north. Only to find new ways of getting discriminated against.
@publicans_sd44 @aaronhorak most GOPers who talk w/ me r only interested in cornering me so they can prove some stupid point or score points
@aaronhorak @publicans_sd44 Yes, that is the essence of it. By being a citizen of US, we agree to this.
@aaronhorak Those are stupid regs, agreed.
@publicans_sd44 @aaronhorak I've never claimed to be polite or mature.
@publicans_sd44 But Dems, generically, think that, too.
@publicans_sd44 That's not a bad def.
@publicans_sd44 @aaronhorak its the stupidity that gets me wound up.
@aaronhorak as if by getting me to answer an idiotic, moronic Q, you've proved something other than ur a RWNJ or something.
@aaronhorak Everything. u are incapable of seeing that ur selfish, delusion pseudo-libertarianism would lead to asking such idiot questions.
@aaronhorak Wow but you pseudo-libertarians have such a selfish, delusional worldview.
@aaronhorak Progressives believe in justice, civil rights for all, living wage and transparent govt. Hmmm that seems like a pretty good def.
@aaronhorak Progressive is abused by anyone vaguely on the left so that it includes them.
from my blog Dirty Kurty for St Paul Mayor http://t.co/sGUNBYTTCX
This. http://t.co/GfXW87TSc2 Read. This.
@aaronhorak You've just redefined the word 'progressive' into something else. I agree w/ u, actually, but progressive isn't the word.

@aaronhorak Now ur starting to get out into Lala land. No, he's a moderate to conservative Dem. Definitely NOT progressive.
@aaronhorak He's a corporate Dem. Sadly, I wasn't so surprised. Depressed and etc., yes, but I didn't succumb to the euphoria quite as much.
@dicktracyorlndo Can't tell much from @suitsmyclothes profile. Hmmm ...
@aaronhorak Truthfully, I'm resigned to it. Our civ libs are being squashed, our govt even more secretive and we still torture.
@truckload_bear That's actually quite funny, but wouldn't it be better if'n s/he wasn't already famous?
