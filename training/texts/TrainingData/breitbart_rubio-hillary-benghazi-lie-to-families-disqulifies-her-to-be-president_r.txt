Thursday on the campaign trail in South Carolina, Republican presidential candidate Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL) said Democratic presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton disqualified herself to be commander-in-chief when she told the family members of the victims of the 2012 terror attack in Benghazi it was not a planned terror attack but a spontaneous protest over an anti-Muslim YouTube video that caused the deaths of their loved ones.Rubio said, “Let me tell you, she’s not qualified to be president. Because, I’m on the intelligence committee. If someone on my staff were to take intelligence information and put it on their server, you know what would happen to them? They would be fired, but they would be prosecuted. You know how they prosecute people that violate intelligence? Look up the name David Petraeus online. You’ll see that. Look at what they did after his service to our country. I’m not saying he was right. He was charged and now take a star or two from retirement as a general. And then you have the secretary of state, took intelligence information, put it on her server. She’s under FBI investigation but she did it because thinks she’s above the law. She’s not above the law. Now if she runs for president, if she wins, she’ll probably pardon herself. But what else she’s not qualified to be, she’s not qualified to be the commander-in-chief. She’s not qualified to be the commander chief. Let me tell you why she’s not qualified to be the commander in chief. When those Americans lost their lives in Benghazi, she knew that was a terrorist attack. And she told other countries that. And she told her relatives and friends that. But you know what she told the families of those people who lost their lives in the service of their country? That it wasn’t a terrorist attack. And here’s what I say, anyone who lies to the families of people who have lost their loved ones in the service of our country can never be the commander in chief of the United States.”
