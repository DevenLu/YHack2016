Republican President-elect Trump just named his three oldest children to the Presidential Transition Team’s executive committee, putting the government of our nation directly involved with the Trump Organization. At no time during the campaign did Trump mention placing his immediate family into an official role, let alone having input in the selection of 4,000 high level federal political appointees.Non-partisan political  of Trump’s personal financial interests and government:Normally, high ranking government officials place their assets into blind trust so they do not know what investments they own, to avoid conflict of interest in making decisions. But family members share the same interests as Trump, and placing his children in charge of the family business means there is nothing blind at all about the President-elect’s financial interests.Politico  that the official transition website read more like a pitch for the Trump Organization, than a government website, though some of the sales language has since been removed:Voters chose Donald Trump to fight corruption, and he’s responded by hiring a team of corporate lobbyists to staff his administration and by turning the Oval Office and numerous executive branch roles in our country’s federal government into another wing of his family’s real estate businesses. Scarily, there’s  to stop Donald Trump from making conflicted decisions as President.
