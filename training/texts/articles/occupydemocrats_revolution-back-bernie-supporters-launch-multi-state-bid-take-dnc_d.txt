The Democratic Party is shedding leaders at the state level parties, and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders’ backers are moving aggressively to seize those posts from Maine to Nebraska, and presumably points in between.  that Bernie backers are ready to contest leadership positions andit’s already known that Sanders is planning to  program with 6,700 Americans who’d like to run for office to reshape the Democratic Party from the ground up.This is the political revolution we need.Bernie Sanders has been campaigning nationally to re-orient the Democratic Party’s agenda via op-editorials and interviews in the wake of this week’s disastrous election. At this year’s convention, Sanders and his followers converted a razor thin electoral disadvantage into the most progressive party platform Democrats have ever ratified.While Clinton supporters were busy buying the biggest electoral disaster money can buy with the checks from their shadowy billionaire donors, Bernie Sanders’ political revolution was staring them in the face at state and national Democratic Party levels. In the wake of this year’s election, the Clinton’s triangulation strategy and network of acolytes failed miserably to rally the party on down ticket races, in state Governor’s races and Senate campaigns, presenting the American left with its most resounding defeat in decades and putting everything the Obama administration has achieved at risk.Equating possession of money with political results is a logical fallacy, and the Clinton supporters who believed in a money machine to carry the day will wake up to find that people still vote in elections and you must support political solutions that empower people to win elections.
